<center><p><strong>Lecture 7. The causes of the need for alternative energy resources</strong></p></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solving the energy crisis is going to take a lot of social action combined with government support. Rising energy costs are finally starting to force global leaders to research alternatives and provide the funding to make changes. Issues like global warming are becoming mainstream reality and causing worldwide concerns about pollution and consumption. Hopefully our civilization will agree to put in the effort needed to save our planet. The articles on this page discuss the politics of renewable energy and change.</p>
<p>A faction within the renewable energy space has slaughtered one of smart growth&rsquo;s sacred cows and set the stage for a strategic realignment of environmental and energy stakeholders struggling for control of the world&rsquo;s future energy economy.</p>
<p>The emerging battle lines pit believers in the environmental and economic benefits of decentralized clean energy against investors in utility-scale, high-impact power plants sited in remote regions and linked to demand centers by an increasingly expensive and unreliable electric power grid. In other words, the clean energy coalition is splintering between those who support the status quo and others like me who believe the profligate economic and environmental wastefulness of the status quo is the challenge clean technology is supposed to solve &ndash; not support.</p>
<p>While there are likely to be charlatans on both sides of this debate, this post is primarily devoted to exposing how the National Renewable Energy Laboratory&rsquo;s multi-volume Renewable Electricity Futures Study presents a dangerously distorted assessment of the status quo (intentionally or unintentionally) that favors the centralized status quo. These distortions are the intellectual equivalent of a slap in the face for environmentalists like me who believe the future welfare of the planet and the people who inhabit it depends on the massive deployment of clean distributed heat and power.</p>
<p>The Renewable Electricity Futures Study considers the opportunities and challenges of integrating significant amounts of renewable energy into the conventional transmission and distribution infrastructure.</p>
<p>Despite past and present administration's hope that the transition from a society dependent on fossil fuels to a world of controlled population growth, sustainable economies and alternative green energies will be forthcoming, the vision seems a bit optimistic. This shift will take strong political and emotional fortitude and decades to accomplish. The transition is not only necessary for the planet's ecological survival; it&rsquo;s critical to the health and well being of every human. Premature death can be caused by acid rain and by particulates in the air that we breathe. Carbon-dioxide emissions are a major culprit in the rapid global warming, which remains a long-range fossil fuel problem.</p>
<p>Virtually everyone agrees that the extraction, distribution, and burning of fossil fuels contribute significantly too many of the planet's environmental problems. This knowledge hasn&rsquo;t yet stopped the ever-increasing consumption of oil and gas by an ever-increasing world population. There are over six billion people on Earth now, nearly double since 1960, and sometime in the next century there will be about 12 billion. According to Jennifer D. Mitchell in World Watch magazine, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anything like a century to prevent that next doubling; we probably have less than a decade&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem is the world&rsquo;s population growth. Right now, there are about 98 people for every square mile of the Earth. That amount is increasing rapidly; every second there are 2 more people on the Earth; every hour 9,000 more; every month adds 6 million more. In other words, this rate of growth is like adding another Mexico to the world each year and another China every decade. In a modern-day century, from 1950 to 2050, the world&rsquo;s population is estimated to grow from 2.5 billion to 9.3 billion an increase of almost 3 times. Currently, the planet&rsquo;s human population is doubling about every 39 years.</p>
<p>With more and more developing countries wanting to offer their growing populations the opportunity to consume fossil fuel products such as gasoline and electricity, it is obvious that the global oil supply will not sustain an overpopulated planet. But the United States and Europe have been consuming a disproportionate amount of energy for 150 years, and it is unreasonable for the industrialized West to expect developing economies, such as the Asian Pacific, to forego the power and wealth that burning fossil fuel brings to industry and commerce.</p>
<p>In the near future the world's economic dependence on fossil fuels will continue to grow because we have implemented few energy alternatives. But there is only so much oil and gas in the ground and it won't last forever.</p>
<p>Under tremendous and increasing pressure politicians will have to address the fossil fuel and pollution crisis. Difficult questions will have to be answered. Key among them is: What alternative energy sources exist to replace our present great dependency on petroleum? New technologies will need about 50 years to replace existing sources in terms of convenience of use. Can they be obtained in significant quantity and how widespread around the world are they? What are their environmental impacts? It would be ideal if politicians began dealing with these problems now, but in democratic societies, political representatives are elected for short terms. Most politicians succeed by delivering short-term benefits and have little motivation to adopt costly, sustainable, long-term energy policies with the aim of preparing for the inevitable energy crisis. The Alliance to Save Energy believes that with just a few adjustments, society will make the jump from unlimited oil consumption to sustainable economies based on improved energy efficiency. But greater energy efficiency, fuel saving technologies and the installation of minor adjustments in our daily lifestyles will not solve the coming oil crunch.</p>
<p>Renewable green energy sources can help reduce pollution and dependence on petroleum products. Wind and solar energy do not create dangerous waste products and are indigenous, secure and freely available. The American Solar Energy Society (ASES) recently called on Congress and the President to increase federal purchases of renewable energy. The federal government spends $8 billion per year for all of its energy needs, including $3.5 billion for electricity. Unfortunately, existing regulations often prevent the federal government from buying renewable energy. ASES wants Congress to give federal agencies authority to purchase green power and renewable energy technologies and to provide adequate funding to agencies to pay the higher up-front costs. Many believe that the problem is more political than technological and that the next presidential election will offer opportunity to make some changes.</p>
<p>Grass roots efforts among green consumers have already begun to carve inroads into the American economy. About 25 percent of the adult population is starting to integrate environmental and social values into purchasing and investing decisions. According to Cliff Feigenbaum, publisher of the Green Money Journal, on Wall Street one dollar out of every ten invested now passes through some sort of social screen. The Institute for Noetic Sciences reports that given equal price and quality, 76 percent of consumers would switch to a company with socially or environmentally responsible products and services.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the process will be easy or extremely difficult, sooner or later we are all going to have to face some major changes to our current way of life. It is not that we lack the knowledge of how to adopt sustainable measures. We are simply resisting such constraints, as many would call them, which might threaten the luxuries in life that we have grown so accustomed to. The point is that we now know the Western fossil-fuel-based model is sustainable neither for the West nor for the rest of the world. The challenge is to help developing countries leapfrog to a more decentralized, efficient, renewables-based system. The alternative to this is following the coal or oil-based path; suffering from price volatility, import dependence, mounting pollution and health problems, and expensive retrofits. Ultimately, the question is not when the global economy will switch from burning environment-damaging and limited petroleum products to using more earth-friendly alternative energies, but how will industry and humanity handle the transition.</p>
