<center><p><strong>Lecture 14. The role of the Republic of Kazakhstan in ensuring energy security in view of the transition to alternative energy resources</strong></p></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To Kazakhstan, as the country with a huge potential of natural resources, which develops in the market conditions, attracted the attention of international organizations and foreign businesses.</p>
<p>First of all, international financial donors work in the country. With the support of USAID is executed a project of CTI-PFAN on RES. CTI-PFAN was created to overcome the lack of coordination between investors, financial institutions and project developers in the field of renewable energy.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of Kazakhstan and the United Nations Development Program &ldquo;Kazakhstan - Wind Power Market Development Initiative&rdquo; developed a project of the National Program of wind energy development until 2015 with prospective until 2030.</p>
<p>The EU is the single largest investor in Kazakhstan, which accounts for more than half of total foreign direct investments in the country. December 4, 2006 the Republic of Kazakhstan and the EU signed a Memorandum of Understanding on energy issues, under which regular meetings on cooperation are held. So, April 25, 2013 hosted the fifth meeting of experts.</p>
<p>Since 1991, the EU allocated to the Republic of Kazakhstan as a technical assistance more than 130 million EUR on strengthening of energy and transport links, including for the implementation of regional programs with the participation of Kazakhstan. Most of the funds allocated to the programs to provide advice and technical assistance to the Government of Kazakhstan, on the basis of EU best practices in priority areas, including the use of renewable energy.</p>
<p>The participation of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the new large-scale EU initiative &ldquo;Covenant of Mayors&rdquo;, combining local, regional and national authorities in achieving voluntary commitments to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 20% by 2020 by increasing energy efficiency and introducing renewable energy sources is very important. Two Kazakhstan cities have already signed the Covenant of Mayors.</p>
<p>EBRD supports Kazakhstan within the project KazSEFF with allocated credit line for projects on energy efficiency and renewable energy (75 million USD), implemented via Kazakh banks. Grant support for the project KazSEFF (2.6 million EUR) is carried out with EU funds.</p>
<p>The Republic of Kazakhstan develops bilateral cooperation with other countries in the field of renewable energy, either through the Agency for International Development of countries or directly with the business.</p>
<p>First of all, it should be noted the agreement with the French CEIS - the first joint project of Kazakh-French Technology Transfer Centre for research on the production of photovoltaic modules from Kazakhstan silicon, based on French and European technologies.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan develops cooperation with several Japanese companies. Among them: NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization), JICA (Japanese International Cooperation Agency) and JAPC (Japan Atomic Power Company). In particular, NEDO identified areas of cooperation for the development of such important areas for Kazakhstan as technologies for the production of thermocouples and solar cells, green technology and energy efficiency, technology for the production of next-generation batteries, water treatment technologies, on June 3, 2010 was signed the Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Indus-try and New Technologies of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Korean Consortium - Korea Electric Power Corporation and Samsung C&amp;T Corporation. In 2010 &ndash; 2016 in the Republic of Kazakhstan it is planned to implement some projects in the field of renewable energy of installed capacity of 1 GW (950 MW wind-power station; 50 MW solar plants).</p>
<p>The German concern Vestas is considering the possibility to invest about 200 million Euro in the construction of wind power plants in Kazakhstan. Currently, the concern developed a business plan for the installation of wind turbines near Astana, Ereimentau and Shelek corridor. Power wind farm is up to 500 MW.</p>
