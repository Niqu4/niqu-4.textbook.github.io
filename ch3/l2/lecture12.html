<center><p><strong>Lecture 12. The perspectives of alternate energy</strong></p></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternative energy sources are seen by many people as potential solutions to the many economic and environmental challenges posed by the current dominance of world energy supply by fossil and nuclear fuels. Just how realistic are these hopes?</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that around 18.4% of primary energy used globally in 2002 (Figure 1) was indeed supplied by alternatives that you have studied in this chapter. However, over 16% of that proportion was from hydropower and traditional uses of biomass, i.e. the inefficient and environmentally damaging burning of fuel wood and animal dung in the poorer parts of the world. Although several alternative sources, such as geothermal, solar and biomass energy have potential for heating and other non-electrical uses, the alternative energy industry&rsquo;s significant feature is the production of electricity by several different means.</p>
<p>Figure 2a shows global changes over three decades for primary energy sources used in electricity generation, in graph form. The two pie charts (Figure 2b) compare the proportions of the major energy sources being used for electricity generation in 1973 and 2003. Coal remained in much the same dominant role throughout those three decades. Significant changes were a marked decrease in the role of oil and increases in nuclear and natural gas. The only alternative source that had a significant role in electricity generation, hydropower, steadily declined in its relative contribution, by more than 5%. The &lsquo;other&rsquo; category consists of the other alternatives discussed in this chapter. Although their role had tripled since 1973, it was still less than 2% in 2003. However rapidly a means of electricity generation is growing, if the growth is from a low starting level it will take a long time to reach a significant proportion of global production.</p>

<p><u>Figure 2</u> (a) The graph shows the increasing contribution of nuclear power to global electricity generation since its introduction in the early 1970s, linear growth in that from fossil fuels, and little change in hydropower. (b) The pie charts show in more detail the changes in contributions from major energy sources between 1973 and 2003, including a breakdown of the fossil fuel contribution shown in the graph in (a). (c) The percentage contribution to global electricity generation by different alternative energy sources in 2000.</p>
<p>The pie chart in Figure 2c is even more revealing. It emphasizes the overwhelming dominance of alternative energy sources by hydropower, the first alternative energy source to be used for electricity generation and also the one closest to reaching its limits. Those alternative sources that receive most attention in the media, particularly solar, wind, wave and tidal, are dwarfed by comparison. Figure 3 shows the disparities between various countries, in terms of their use of alternative energy sources.</p>

<p>Figures 2 and 3 give a vivid impression of the magnitude of the changes needed to make any impression on the dominance of fossil and nuclear fuel usage. To achieve those changes requires political and industrial commitment to invest in and construct alternative sources, and to phase-out &lsquo;conventional&rsquo; energy sources. For example, an estimate of the contribution of solar PV electrical power to global electricity generation use in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century is 0.001%. Judge from that the magnitude of effort required for photovoltaic technology to have a significant effect on energy use patterns.</p>
<p>For other alternatives, the outlook is somewhat more optimistic, yet their potential is far less than that of solar energy. Interestingly, in 1941 only 0.02% of US households had a television, yet by 2000, 98% had at least one. That is a good indication of how demand can drive rapid growth in supply, especially when improved technology helps reduce price. But the demand for television sets, and indeed any consumer goods, is very different from that for energy supply; the first is specific to a use, whereas the second is general. Although increasing numbers of people are becoming aware of the necessity for changes in how energy is produced, they are still a tiny minority. Whatever their sentiments, they have little choice in the form and sources of the energy that they use, as shown by Figure 2. Nonetheless, in 2004 there were high growth rates for some alternatives in some areas; China was developing geothermal resources at about 12% growth annually (doubling period of 5.8 years); &lsquo;high-tech&rsquo; use of biomass was growing globally at 20% (doubling every 3.5 years); in the EU wind power was growing at about 25% (a 2.8-year doubling).</p>
<p>As you have seen, alternative energy sources are very different as regards the technologies required to extract power that exists naturally. They are just as diverse in the context of their geographic availability. Coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear fuels are commodities that can be shipped globally to wherever there is a market for them. For the industrialized parts of the world, much the same happens with electricity, through national and international grid distribution using cables. Apart from biomass (an expensive proposition considering its low intrinsic value), alternative energy sources cannot be exported or imported in their natural form! So, it is very difficult to estimate what the ultimate potential of each type of source for human use might be.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;baseline&rsquo; from which to judge the relative potential of each alternative is the global power that they &lsquo;deliver&rsquo; naturally. You might like to look at the other units on alternative energy. Each unit has summarized the technical and geographic challenges posed by each alternative source. It is left to you to judge the feasibility of implementing these changes against the claims for &lsquo;alternative&rsquo; solutions to global energy challenges that are regularly made. It does seem, however, that solar and wind energy are likely to make the most rapid impact, judging by their industries&rsquo; rates of growth in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, and by their potential to deliver by far the greatest power. However, changing the pattern of energy supply is a matter neither of relative abundances nor environmental common sense. It boils down to cost, and some interesting information that compares alternative and conventional costs of installation and supply. Note that the cost of installing renewable energy plant is from 3 to 30 times higher per kW of power capacity than for conventional power stations. Note also that solar photovoltaic is &lsquo;priced out&rsquo; of all markets at present, and both coal and natural gas will continue to have a competitive edge for at least the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>At the outset of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, alternative energy sources contributed almost a fifth of global primary energy supply, mostly from large-scale hydropower and traditional biofuel burning in poorer countries. Neither is environmentally &lsquo;friendly&rsquo;, or without serious damage to society. The more promising alternative sources account individually for tiny proportions of current global energy supply. In order to significantly supplant fossil fuels, avoid global warming and foster economic sustainability in the next half century, they require very high global growth rates.</p>
<p>Unlike fossil and nuclear fuels, alternatives other than biofuels are not practicably portable. Nonetheless, most of them have no economic cost except for that involved in conversion to useful forms of energy. Despite the publicity that surrounds all forms of alternative energy source, only direct and PV solar and wind power can make a significant contribution to global energy supplies.</p>
