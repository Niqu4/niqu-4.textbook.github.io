<center><p><strong>Lecture 8. The impact of alternative energy resources on the foreign policy of states</strong></p></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automakers are looking into the next generation electric or hybrid cars. The main resource for the battery would be lithium, already used in smaller electronic devices and far more efficient and longer-lasting than regular batteries.</p>
<p>For example, almost half the world&rsquo;s lithium is found in Bolivia, and as The Seattle Times notes, Bolivia is reluctant to give up lithium resources too easily.</p>
<p>Bolivia and the US have had thorny relations as the democratically elected socialist and indigenous leader, Evo Morales, has nationalized oil and gas companies, much to the disappointment of the US, and with general support from his population as he attempts to slowly develop the extremely poor nation.</p>
<p>This means that the European Union and Japan have been trying to court Bolivia in the hopes they can invest in lithium extraction.</p>
<p>But geopolitics are again the concern; Bolivia fears that others will exploit it for rich resources, just as most resource-rich nations have been plundered/exploited in the past. It may be that this time the exploitation may not be as violent as during imperial and colonial times, but resource-rich/economically-poor nations like Bolivia are understandably hesitant to give up a valuable resource without local benefits.</p>
<p>One of the interesting aspects to alternatives to fossil fuels is if any of those alternatives can by generated by citizens themselves or in more localized settings, rather than relying on governments or massive industry to supply such alternatives.</p>
<p>If that were to happen, it implies enormous political change. This is summarized quite well by the following article that looks at the implication of Cold Fusion becoming reality (ignoring the debate and controversy about Cold Fusion claims for the moment):</p>
<p>Suddenly, certain areas of the world that have built up economies based on oil production would become less important. These areas might suffer economically. However, it would take a period of time for the world to transition to a cold fusion based economy and these nations would have years to prepare.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;powers that be&rdquo; also might not like the idea that this technology could give individuals, communities, cities, states, and small countries energy independence. Cheap energy represents unlimited wealth and wealth brings power. The powers that be do not like sharing power. A technology that could give people the ability to live &ldquo;off the grid&rdquo;, start self sufficient communities, or liberate themselves from oppressive central governments might be considered a threat.</p>
<p>This technology literally gives power to the people. How will the governments of the world respond to that? (Hank Mills, Future Impact of Rossi&rsquo;s Cold Fusion, Pure Energy Systems News, February 28, 2011).</p>
<p>As countries throughout the world strive to maintain their national security and viable economies, energy security is one of the most important and contentious issues facing them. This reality has put energy at the top of the international geopolitical agenda. The fact that it is so important, especially to the leading and strongest countries, allows energy suppliers to assert political leverage and to wield power themselves. As we have seen, Europe&rsquo;s economy and even way of life have been blackmailed by countries seeking to achieve political capital by disrupting the flow of energy.</p>
<p>Energy security, though always at the top of the agenda, was not a matter of major concern for Europe until the 1970s when energy crises severely damaged its economy. The decade which followed was relatively quite in that respect, but since 1991 a number of developments have returned the international focus to the dangerous relationship between energy and politics. Moreover, with the passage of time the dependence of consumer countries, especially with the rise of China, India and other substantial consumers, has made the situation even more delicate.</p>
<p>The previous chapters dealt with measures taken by Germany as a case study of the wider EU policies in the renewable energy sector. These measures contributed to Germany&rsquo;s economy and made it less dependent on energy. This chapter seeks to prove my main assumption by addressing the issue with which this paper began, namely the relationship between energy and politics &ndash; but from a more contemporary perspective. Therefore, it will be divided into two parts: the first will address major events in the geopolitical landscape since the fall of the Iron Curtain, showing the importance of energy independence; the second will present statements by Community, European and German leaders that demonstrate the relationship between energy security, especially energy dependence, and foreign policy. Demonstrating that link is requisite to showing that the renewable energy sector can be used as a tool in foreign policy; it has been and, hopefully, will continue to be an important factor in reducing energy dependence.</p>
<p>The first event to be considered is global and exceeds the boundaries of the EU. During the 1990s and especially in the last decade, the effects of man-induced climate change have been evident almost everywhere on the planet. Icebergs are melting, the sea level is rising, droughts and floods occur in poor countries and storms are stronger and can cause catastrophic damage, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although at first glance there is no connection between climate change and geopolitics, a closer look reveals otherwise. One of the major effects of climate change is the desertification of many parts of the world, meaning there is less fresh water for drinking and watering crops. This desertification has even been viewed as one of the factors which impelled the genocide in Darfur. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon attributed the ethnic and religious violence there partially to global warming, stating: &ldquo;The Darfur conflict began as an ecological crisis, arising at least in part from climate change&rdquo;. Desertification can also cause migration to more prosperous regions, leading to conflicts over fertile land as it becomes scarcer. As for the melting of icebergs, it could cause the displacement of over half of mankind while allowing better access to the North Pole. This region is considered to be rich in untapped oil and gas reserves, and with many countries claiming ownership over it, even greater tensions over energy resources could result.</p>
<p>The substantial and even dramatic effects climate change can have on geopolitics show, to some extent, that the promotion of renewable energy is aimed at avoiding such potentially catastrophic changes &ndash; underlining the strong link between renewable energy promotion and geopolitics.</p>
<p>The second event, which at first seemed unconnected to the energy realm, emerged over the years as crucial for understanding the geopolitics of energy &ndash; namely the collapse of the Soviet Union. The end of the bipolar world system allowed many countries, which possess energy resources and used to be under Soviet rule, to offer their commodities to large energy consumers. At first, supplying oil to Western countries was done via pipelines that were built during the Cold War and pass through Russian territory. Over the years, however, new pipelines were built to supply oil to the West that does not use Russia as a transit country. Over the past decade, the rise of China and India as major energy consumers has opened large new markets for these two countries to meet their growing demands. This entire means that Russia&rsquo;s loss was double: first, it lost its revenues from oil and gas pipelines passing through its territory; second, it ceased to be the only energy supplier in its former area of influence. Thus, to some extent it has lost its leverage over the West as an energy supplier.</p>
