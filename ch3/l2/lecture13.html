<center><p><strong>Lecture 13. Cooperation of the states of Central Asia in the sphere of alternate energy</strong></p></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central Asia countries have significant potential for energy efficiency and renewable energy. The priority directions in its implementation are determined by the national programs of each country.</p>
<p>As shows the analysis of the implementation of national programs, the potential of little use and planned activities are often not implemented in the specified amounts as scheduled. It causes significant economic damage of each country. Active promotion of technologies to improve efficiency and renewable energy in Central Asian countries would have a positive impact on economic growth rates, living standards, scientific development and technology in these countries.</p>
<p>The information presented in this lecture has shown that the significant impetus to the implementation of advanced technologies in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy can provide regional cooperation between the countries of Central Asia. The basis of such cooperation should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooperation in order to build closed chains (cycles) of the production and use of renewable resources;</li>
<li>Interstate (regional) coordination of the RES participation in national energy systems, energy saving for the energy security of the Central Asia region;</li>
<li>Exchange of know-how, best practices in energy efficiency and renewable energy;</li>
<li>Development of common approaches to the creation of infrastructure for renewable energy and energy efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic element of regional cooperation should be the harmonization of national programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy of Central Asia countries. In our opinion, the main directions of harmonization are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of common approaches to the structure and content of the national programs in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy.</li>
<li>Inclusion in the program of each country of the region of a special section reflecting and evaluating the potential of bilateral and regional cooperation. It is important to specify the technical and economic potential for the realization of this potential, the stages of the national programs.</li>
<li>In the same section of national programs is useful to determine the appropriate set of joint projects and activities of the two cooperating countries or the countries of the region to realize the potential.</li>
<li>Critical condition for effective collaboration is the availability of funding. Therefore, the most important area of harmonization is to develop schemes and instruments of co-financing of joint projects and activities that will be planned in the specified section of the national programs.</li>
<li>Coordination of enforcement mechanisms, establishing responsibility and monitoring the implementation of joint projects and activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Harmonization of national programs should be preceded by harmonization of the relevant provisions and necessary additions of national legislation in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy.</p>
<p>The growth of the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in the fuel and energy balances of industrialized countries has become one of the tendencies of modern economic development, determining its stability. In the advanced countries of the European Union (EU), according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), energy production from renewable energy sources is growing annually by 10-20%.</p>
<p>According to Eurostat, if in 2004, 7.9% of EU electricity was obtained from renewable energy sources; in 2011 the figure was over 13%.</p>
<p>According to the European Council for Renewable Energy by 2040, renewable sources could provide 50% of energy production in the world. In accordance with the decision of the European Parliament the share of renewable energy in the EU energy balance in 2020 should be 20%, in 2040 - 40%.</p>
<p>Energy development in the countries of Central Asia is largely determined by their role in the energy system of the former USSR and by the facilities that were built before its fall down. So, thanks to built in the former USSR powerful cascades of hydropower plants on the mountain rivers of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, the share of renewable energy (RE) high and makes more than half and about a third of the energy balance in those countries. While in Kazakhstan and in Turkmenistan, which has rich reserves of traditional energy resources, the use of renewable energy is practically absent.</p>
<p>According to expert estimates the potential of energy saving and renewable energy in Central Asia is significant and requires its use.</p>
<p>At the moment, the state programs which aim to realize the potential of energy saving and renewable energy sources were developed and adopted in each of the five countries of Central Asia. However, the improvement of energy efficiency in various sectors of the economy and the development of renewable energy are carried out at different rates and in various fields, depending on climatic and economic conditions in these countries.</p>
<p>The analysis showed that the main driving forces in the development of renewable energy in Central Asia countries are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Striving for energy security,</li>
<li>Providing flexibility of national power grid in order to participate in the regional electricity markets,</li>
<li>Possibility of energy supply in remote regions where there is no electricity infrastructure,</li>
<li>Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the country's obligations and / or recommendations of the relevant international institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Production of renewable energy in Central Asia is particularly important for remote areas where there are no electric networks. Increased use of renewable energy will have a positive impact on the quality of life of the population, and its employment will contribute to the growth of the economy, science and technology of Central Asia.</p>
<p>However, today despite the government decision making, the pace of development of energy efficiency and renewable energy are obviously insufficient. The solution of these problems in national programs is behind the practical implementation. For example, any major project in the field of renewable energy is not implemented in the republics.</p>
<p>Taking into account the similarity of natural and climatic conditions, economic structures, common borders of Central Asian countries it should be recommended to collaborate and share knowledge and practices in the field of energy saving and renewable energy. It will provide synergistic effects with saved resources.</p>
<p>In recent years, in Central Asia countries a great importance is attached to energy saving in terms of compensation for the lack of generating capacity and/or release of additional volumes of energy re-sources for export, and the development of renewable energy is seen primarily as a means to pre-vent climate change and environmental protection, as well as in the framework of energy supply in remote and inaccessible areas. Energy efficiency and renewable energy in the countries is becoming the most important area in the energy sector, as it allows reducing demand for solid investment in the energy sector.</p>
<p>For the conditions of Central Asia countries, the most advanced fields of application of renewable energy sources should be considered decentralized facilities located in remote mountainous and desert areas: farming, cattle-breeding complexes, geological and mining enterprises, road services, hydrometeorological scientific observation stations, radio repeaters, objects of tourist-health centers, pumping stations, forestry and hunting farms, etc.</p>
<p>On the one hand, these countries should improve the efficiency of conventional energy, for example, introducing more efficient combined heat and power units at CHPs, on the other hand they should increase energy efficiency in industry, housing and utilities sector, agriculture, in transport and in social sphere. It is also required the development of renewable energy sources, taking into account the specifics of each country.</p>
