<center><p><strong>Lecture 10. International legal mechanisms of regulation of interstate relations in the field of alternative energy (IRENA, UN, ITER)</strong></p></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several organizations dealing with regulations of renewable energy in the field of international relations, including the UN, FAO, IEA and IAEA. But one of the key international organizations promoting alternative energy is the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).</p>
<p>IRENA seeks to make an impact in the world of renewable energy by maintaining a clear and independent position, providing a range of reliable and well-understood services that complement those already offered by the renewable energy community and gather existing, but scattered, activities around a central hub.</p>
<p>The international renewable energy community is large, resourceful, and rapidly evolving. IRENA does not duplicate what others are doing, but seeks out, establishes and develops new synergies, facilitates dialogue, and information and best practice sharing. Cooperation at the global, regional and national levels, knowledge sharing, enabling policies and enhanced capacity, as well as the encouragement of investment flows and strengthened technology and innovation, are essential elements in the Agency&rsquo;s efforts. IRENA is positioning itself as a platform for all-inclusive cooperation where stakeholders can make a positive contribution to the common goals. This cooperation and partnerships are essential underpinnings of IRENA&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Numerous international, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations are natural and indispensable partners, as are many private sector companies who are already seizing the opportunities offered by renewable energy. Civil society groups can also contribute to the IRENA vision by being vocal advocates and observers of actions taken by governments, non-governmental organizations and the private sector. IRENA directs its principal partnership activities towards knowledge sharing, ensuring that existing information and experience is developed, organized, and made accessible in a usable format.</p>
<p>IRENA is uniquely positioned to bring together these different constituencies. It aims to become the convening instrument that binds all parts together and become a powerful force in advancing the agenda of the widespread adoption and use of renewable energy, with the ultimate goal of safeguarding a sustainable future.</p>
<p><u>Creation of IRENA</u></p>
<p>The proposal for an international agency dedicated towards renewable energy was made in 1981 at the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy in Nairobi. The idea was further discussed and developed by major organizations in the field of renewable energy, in particular Eurosolar.</p>
<p>Since then, the global interest in renewable energy has been increasing: Several international meetings such as the World Summit for Sustainable Development 2002 in Johannesburg (WSSD) or the G-8 Gleneagles Dialogue addressed renewable energy, and the 2004 Bonn International Renewable Energy Conference in Bonn, as well as the 2005 Beijing International Renewable Energy Conference were a response of Governments towards the increasing demand for further international cooperation on renewable energy policies, financing, and technologies.</p>
<p>It is important to recall that the International Conference for Renewable Energies in Bonn 2004, supported by the International Parliamentary Forum on Renewable Energies called for the establishment of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in its concluding resolution. Only a few years later, and through combined efforts of Governments across the world, the idea had come to life.</p>
<p>IRENA&rsquo;s first Preparatory Conference (Berlin, 10-11 April 2008) with a rapidly growing energy demand on the one hand, and climate change associated with current patterns of energy use on the other, the meeting of the &lsquo;IRENA Initiative&rsquo; took place at a critical juncture. 170 representatives from 60 states expressed their overall support for the founding of an International Renewable Energy Agency as early as possible - the political momentum was with the &lsquo;IRENA Initiative&rsquo; now. Whilst the basic instruments of such an Agency were to be agreed upon at a later stage, the objective was clear: IRENA should be become the very first intergovernmental organization on a global scale dedicated towards the promotion of renewable energy.</p>
<p>Preparatory Workshops (Berlin, 30 June &ndash; 1 July 2008) two parallel Workshops were convened in Berlin from 30 June to 1 July 2008, in order to prepare the groundwork. The workshops, attended by over 100 representatives of more than 44 states, discussed the founding treaty of IRENA (the &lsquo;Statute&rsquo;), the financing mechanisms, and the outline of an initial work programme. The workshops were yet another important step in the establishment of IRENA.</p>
<p>IRENA&rsquo;s final Preparatory Conference (Madrid, 23-24 October 2008) the final Preparatory Conference was held only half a year after the first Preparatory Conference, again underlining the strong commitment of Governments towards renewable energies. More than 150 representatives from 51 states gathered to discuss the key issues that would ultimately enable the quick-start formation of IRENA in January 2009: The draft Statue was agreed upon, important matters such as financing, and the criteria and procedures for selecting the Interim Director-General and the Interim Headquarters, as well as the design of the initial phase of IRENA, were resolved. The Final Preparatory Conference represented a milestone in the founding process of IRENA, and in the run-up to the Founding Conference further states became attracted to the idea of IRENA and joined the initiative.</p>
<p>IRENA Founding Conference (Bonn, 26 January 2009) the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) was officially founded in Bonn on 26 January 2009. The founding of IRENA was a significant milestone for world renewable energy deployment and a clear sign that the global energy paradigm was changing as a result of the growing commitments from governments. At the Founding Conference 75 States from all over the world signed IRENA&rsquo;s Statute.</p>
<p>Considering the magnitude and urgency of the tasks ahead for IRENA, it was important that IRENA commenced its activities as quickly as possible. To bridge the gap between the ratification of IRENA&rsquo;s Statute by a quorum of 25 States which still was to come, and the urgent need for establishing IRENA and initiate first activities, a Preparatory Commission was instigated on the day following the Founding Conference.</p>
<p>IRENA Preparatory Commission Sessions (2009-2011). The Preparatory Commission for IRENA, consisting of IRENA&rsquo;s Signatory States and acting as the interim institutional body, had a key role in preparing the relevant institutional structures for this new intergovernmental organization, ranging from the location of the headquarters and the appointment of the first Director-General, and administrative policies and procedures, to the implementation of first renewable energy projects.</p>
<p>Between 2009 and 2011, five sessions of the Preparatory Commission for IRENA were held. At the second session in June 2009, Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) was selected to host the Interim Headquarters of IRENA, and Helene Pelosse, a French citizen, was appointed the first Interim Director-General of IRENA.</p>
<p>First session (January 26, 2009)</p>
<p>Second session (Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, June 29-30, 2009)</p>
<p>Third session (Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, January 17, 2010)</p>
<p>Fourth session (Abu Dhabi, October 24-25, 2010)</p>
<p>Fifth session (Abu Dhabi, 3 April 2011).</p>
<p>An Administrative Committee was formed to assist the Preparatory Commission in preparing its next sessions, support the necessary next steps, and ensure efficient internal and external communication.</p>
<p>Following the entry into force of the Statute on 8 July 2010 the preparations for the first Assembly of IRENA were started. On 4 April 2011, only three years after the very first conference regarding IRENA was held, the Preparatory Commission of IRENA ceased to exist, and the International Renewable Energy Agency was finally born.</p>
<p><u>ITER (the Latin word for &ldquo;The Way&rdquo;)</u> is a large-scale scientific experiment intended to prove the viability of fusion as an energy source. ITER is currently under construction in the south of France. In an unprecedented international effort, seven partners&mdash;China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States&mdash;have pooled their financial and scientific resources to build the biggest fusion reactor in history. ITER will not produce electricity, but it will resolve critical scientific and technical issues in order to take fusion to the point where industrial applications can be designed. By producing 500 MW of power from an input of 50 MW&mdash;a &ldquo;gain factor&rdquo; of 10&mdash;ITER will open the way to the next step: a demonstration fusion power plant.</p>
<p>On-site construction of the scientific facility began in 2010. As the buildings rise at the ITER site in southern France, the fabrication of large-scale mock-ups and components is underway in the factories of the seven ITER Members. The shipment of the first completed components began in 2014 and will continue for at least five years. Machine assembly will begin as soon as the giant Tokamak Complex is ready for occupation.</p>
<p>ITER is one of the most complex scientific and engineering projects in the world today. The complexity of the ITER design has already pushed a whole range of leading-edge technologies to new levels of performance. However, further science and technology are needed to bridge the gap to commercialization of fusion energy.</p>
<p>Of the magnetic confinement concepts for fusion (mainly tokamaks and stellarators) the main advantage of ITER and its tokamak technology is that, for the time being, the tokamak concept is by far the most advanced along the road to producing fusion energy. It is consequently pragmatism that dictated the choice of the tokamak concept for ITER. Stellarators are inherently more complex than tokamaks (for example, optimized designs were not possible before the advent of supercomputers) but they may have advantages in reliability of operation. The W7-X Stellarator, which should celebrate its first plasma in 2015 in Greifswald, Germany, will allow good benchmarking against the performance of comparable tokamaks. These results will be incorporated in decisions about how DEMO, the next-generation fusion device after ITER, will look.</p>
<p>The inertial fusion concepts are something quite different. These technologies have mainly been developed to simulate nuclear explosions and were not originally planned to produce fusion energy. The inertial fusion concept has not demonstrated so far that it offers a better or shorter path than magnetic confinement to energy production. In Europe, the Euratom Framework Programs do not fund research on inertial fusion, but the program maintains a &ldquo;watching brief&rdquo; on developments.</p>
<p>The choice was made from the beginning to share the manufacturing of the most strategically important components among the seven ITER Members. This has considerably added to the complexity of the project, but the reasons for this decision were clear&mdash;by participating in ITER, each Member is preparing its industrial infrastructure, its scientific base, and its physicists and engineers for the next step on the road to fusion power: the construction of a demonstration fusion power plant.</p>
<p>It seems clear that no one Member has the financial and technical resources to build ITER alone. In this sense, by contributing only a portion of the project's costs, each Member benefits from the totality of the development program (where, already, there have been discoveries in technology, materials, science and even the first applications for patents) and, later, the totality of the 20-year experimental program.</p>
<p>Collaboration and coordination between the different entities of the project are improving all of the time. What is remarkable about fusion research is that, for a very long time, it has been an international, collaborative venture where discoveries in one area of the world immediately benefit other research programs. This is true every day at ITER, where the project benefits from the diverse experiences of its Members, including research underway on operational tokamaks in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>If ITER were only a construction project, its model would certainly have been organized differently. But as the world&rsquo;s largest and most challenging energy research project, the collaboration between seven ITER Members&mdash;all with decades of experience in fusion&mdash;has been most profitable in terms of pooling resources to solve the difficult challenges that remain on the road to fusion.</p>
