<p>As the renewable energy sector grows, its role in reducing energy dependence grows, allowing the Community to refer to the sector when addressing its external dimension, i.e. foreign relations. The following are examples which emphasize this connection: &ldquo;Their (renewable energy) use reduces our greenhouse gas emissions, diversifies our energy supply and reduces our dependence on unreliable and volatile fossil fuel markets (in particular oil and gas)&rdquo;. Energy Commissioner Andris Piebglas also has acknowledged renewable energy&rsquo;s role in wider European policies: &ldquo;Climate change, increasing oil and fossil fuel dependence, and rising energy prices: all these factors are rendering Europe increasingly vulnerable. Our sustainable future largely depends on increased use of renewable energies&rdquo;. He goes even further to state: &ldquo;Europe must lead the world on a new industrial revolution: the development of a low carbon economy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A similar perspective can be found in references to the matter by the High Representative for the Common and Foreign Policy, Javier Solana, and the president of the Commission, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso. According to Solana, the energy issue is tightly linked to international politics. He raises a number of objectives which countries of the Community will have to pursue in order to tackle rising consumption and reduce dependence: diversifying suppliers, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. All these, Solana maintain are necessary not only to fight climate change but also as part of a common European foreign energy policy. Such a policy will allow the EU to promote its ideology of human rights, accountability and the role of civilian power in politics, instead of the hard power which is part of the current energy realm around the world. Another aspect of the connection between foreign policy and energy, Solana notes, is that fossil fuel-rich countries are nine times more prone to suffer from instability. The instability in these countries is attributed to corruption and insufficient economic diversification. This underlines the importance of the EU promoting the use of renewable energy and not depending on such countries. Looking towards the future, Solana believes a common energy policy and pursuing the paths he mentioned earlier will enable the EU to exert pressure of its own on its energy suppliers, such as Russia.</p>
<p>In referring to the &ldquo;20-20-20 climate change targets&rdquo;, he meant the 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 20% share for renewables in final energy consumption and a 20% saving in future energy demand by 2020. The second goal is one of the major objectives of the 2007 &ldquo;Renewable Energy Road Map&rdquo;. Other departments of the Commission have also addressed this relationship. The Commission of External Relations, while referring to important issues related to peace and security, stated that some policies which seemingly are internal actually have a strong external dimension, one of them being energy.</p>
<p>In addition to Community officials, national leaders such as German chancellor Angela Merkel have spoken about the connection between energy dependence and regional or world politics. In April 2006, in a speech to German political and industrial leaders, she proposed a plan to reshape, together with the large energy companies, the German energy sector. She said: &ldquo;We agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy, to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the theoretical terms of the international relations field, energy resources are a realistic issue par excellence. That was indeed overwhelmingly the case until the 1973 energy crisis, but that crisis introduced other elements into the energy realm that were of a more liberal and constructive nature. From being almost solely confined to the world of commerce, the energy realm now entered the world of politics, ideals and religious ambitions, all of which has transformed it permanently. Countries which once were considered weak became more powerful than ever and have threatened to change the world order by using the new energy weapon, weapon consumer countries had no ability to deal with as even substantial military power proved inadequate.</p>
<p>Seemingly, in order to achieve energy security, the Community would have to take a realistic approach and use hard-power tools. Yet it had no effective military capability, and economic tools are only effective to some extent. In order to achieve sustainable energy security, the EU could not use its economic power indefinitely. The changing reality, however, gave the Community a golden opportunity to use the tools it aspires to, and to modify its approach to the ostensibly realistic issue of energy supplies.</p>
<p>As noted, the Community has taken a number of steps in that context. It has diversified its suppliers and supplies by using diplomacy and exporting its norms. For example, it has concluded agreements with countries which aspire to a strong relationship with the Community, such as the former Soviet countries of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. The EU has also taken steps in energy conservation involving the insulation of homes, setting a normative guideline for electrical-appliances efficiency and so on. A similar approach is apparent in the renewable energy sector, where the Community has utilized legislative measures and a network of institutions such as companies, corporations, universities and private researchers, all serving as agents of norms and change &ndash; thereby underlining the importance of renewable energy in fighting climate change and reducing energy dependence.</p>
<p>The Community understood that although achieving energy security is an objective of a realistic nature, it can be obtained in other ways. The success of the EU&rsquo;s approach is evident in the growth of the renewable energy sector over the years.</p>
