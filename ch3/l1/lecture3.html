<p><em>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION &ndash; GOVERNMENTS</em></p>
<p>Several important projects involve international collaboration at government level: The Generation IV International Forum (GIF), the International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO), the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) which in 2010 became the International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation (IFNEC), and the Multinational Design Evaluation Program (MDEP). In addition, there is the ITER project focused on nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) is a US-led grouping set up in 2001 which has identified six reactor concepts for further investigation with a view to commercial deployment by 2030. It is focused on new reactor technology. See Generation IV paper.</p>
<p>The IAEA&rsquo;s International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO) is focused more on assessment methodology for developing country needs. It involves users as much a technology holders and has 39 countries including several which do not yet have nuclear power. INPRO supports countries as they develop long-range national nuclear energy strategies using INPRO&rsquo;s nuclear energy systems assessment (NESA) and the INPRO Methodology (see section on <em>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION &ndash; UN</em> above). There are seven projects within INPRO which provide insights into various aspects of nuclear energy systems development &ndash; from infrastructure to economics, non-proliferation and safety. It is now funded through the IAEA budget.</p>
<p>Both these projects are aimed at enhancing safety, reducing capital costs, improving utilisation of natural resources, reducing wastes, and improving proliferation resistance and physical protection.</p>
<p>The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) initiated in 2006 was US-led and aimed to &ldquo;work with other nations possessing advanced nuclear technologies to develop new proliferation-resistant recycling technologies in order to produce more energy, reduce waste and minimize proliferation concerns&rdquo;. Two technical elements of it were new reprocessing technologies which separate all transuranic elements together (and not reactor-grade plutonium on its own) and Advanced Burner (fast) Reactors (ABR) to consume the result of this while generating power. The main political aspects are restricting deployment of enrichment and reprocessing technologies outside the main nuclear countries. In mid 2010 this became the International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation (IFNEC), a partnership of countries aiming to ensure that new nuclear in initiatives meet the highest standards of safety, security and non-proliferation.</p>
<p>Russia has made a corresponding proposal for a global network of fuel cycle facilities under UN oversight, in proposing the International Fuel Cycle Centre (INFCC) concept. These would include international uranium enrichment centers such as that being set up by Russia and Kazakhstan at Angarsk in Siberia (utilizing one of its enrichment plants to be under international control), reprocessing and waste management centers, training centers and R&amp;D centers.</p>
<p>This leads to consideration of fuel leasing, whereby a utility leases its fabricated fuel from a supplier, probably in another country, and after it has been used that supplier takes it back. This concept is not yet in use except for some very limited applications. The supplier would then add the leased used fuel to its own larger stocks to be stored for later disposal or reprocessing and recycling, in which case the valuable components would belong to the fuel supplier/leaser. Of all the nuclear suppliers, Russia has expressed the most support for fuel leasing and take-back. Russia&rsquo;s fuel supply contract with Iran involves leasing, and Iran is required to send the used fuel back to Russia. Current Russian law makes it possible for Russia to take back Russian-origin fuel without requiring return of the wastes, which appears to be the approach in the contract with Iran.</p>
<p>Related to both IFNEC and the Russian initiative is the question of international guarantee of fuel supplies for countries which do not have enrichment and related facilities, and which agree not to embark upon building them. The IAEA has taken a lead in asserting the need for this and is proposing to consult its member states and others on a possible new framework to set up a multilateral nuclear fuel supply assurance system. This could involve setting up virtual or actual fuel banks &ndash; as proposed by the USA and other countries &ndash; and/or international enrichment centers &ndash; as being undertaken by Russia. The IAEA is also assessing the technical, institutional and legal implications. Practical problems include how to assure supply of fabricated fuel assemblies, given problems of design and intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>The Multinational Design Evaluation Program&nbsp;(MDEP) was launched in 2006 by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) to develop innovative approaches to leverage the resources and knowledge of national regulatory authorities reviewing new reactor designs. It is led by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and involves the IAEA and 14 countries. It aims to develop multinational regulatory standards for design of Gen IV reactors. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has proposed a three-stage process culminating in international design certification for new reactor types, notably Generation IV types. Twelve countries are involved so far: Canada, China, Finland, France, India (from 2012), Japan, Korea, Russia, South Africa, Sweden (from 2013), UK, USA, and others which have or are likely to have firm commitments to building new nuclear plants may be admitted &ndash; the UAE is an associate member.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MDEP pools the resources of its member nuclear regulatory authorities for the purpose of co-operating on safety reviews of designs of nuclear reactors that are under construction and undergoing licensing in several countries, and ii) exploring opportunities and potential for harmonization of regulatory requirements and practices. It also produces reports and guidance documents that are shared internationally beyond the MDEP membership.</p>
<p>In relation to Gen IV reactors, the NRC has called for countries involved in their development to develop common design requirements so that regulatory standards can be harmonized. NRC has published its draft design requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the MDEP is being used to share information among countries engaged in certifying particular new reactor designs, notably the EPR and AP1000, but with APR1400, VVER designs, and ABWR-ESBWR following. MDEP members are looking at different design codes to ensure that consistently high safety standards are achieved in different countries. Harmonization of design requirements will ultimately assist this, in the same way as has been achieved in civil aviation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contact Expert Group (CEG) was established in September 1995 by a group of interested countries and international organizations with the IAEA as its Secretariat. Its aim is to enhance safety of waste management in Russia and to promote international co-operative efforts aimed at resolving radioactive waste management issues. Its members include Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Sweden, UK, USA, European Union, as well as the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), and the International Science and Technology Centre (ISTC), with Japan and the Nordic Environment Finance Corp as observers.</p>
<p>ISTC is an intergovernmental organization based in Moscow, established in 1992 by the EU, Japan, Russia and the USA. It offers weapons scientists from CIS countries the chance to use their skills for peaceful purposes. Since 1992, other countries have joined including Norway, South Korea, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. By the end of March 2001, the ISTC's programs had funded 1250 projects worth $335 million, providing grant payments to over 30,000 individuals.</p>
<p>In 1985 the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency set up an international Co-operative Program on Decommissioning nuclear facilities and this has grown into a major success, sharing knowledge and experience.</p>
<p><em>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION &ndash; RESEARCH</em></p>
<p>Several major research reactor programs have invited international participation, particularly in the light of international cooperation directed to Generation IV reactor designs and fuel cycles.</p>
<p>The European Sustainable Nuclear Industrial Initiative (ESNII) brings together industry and research partners in the development of Generation IV fast neutron reactor technology, as part of the EU's Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan). ESNII was set up under the umbrella of the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP), formed in 2007 and bringing together more than 90 stakeholders involved in nuclear fission.</p>
<p>Belgium&rsquo;s SCK. CEN is planning to build the MYRRHA (Multipurpose Hybrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) research reactor at Mol. Initially it will be a 57 MWt accelerator-driven system (ADS), but later on it is intended to be run as a critical fast neutron facility, decoupling the accelerator and removing the spallation loop from the reactor core. Then MYRRHA (as a lead-bismuth cooled fast reactor &ndash; LFR) will be used for fuel research, for materials research for Generation IV reactors, and for the production of radioisotopes and doped silicon (an essential component of high-grade electronic circuits). It is envisaged as a partnership of Belgium, the European Union, the European Investment Bank and other partners, with 70% of the funding from EU countries under ESNII. Following an independent international evaluation, Belgium approved its 40% share of the funding in March 2010 &ndash; about &euro;384 million &ndash; which puts the project on course for construction start in 2015 and operation about 2023. In October 2010 SCK-CEN signed two international agreements to collaborate on the Myrrha project. The first is with the China Academy of Sciences, since China sees as Myrrha a way forward in treating nuclear wastes. The second is with Kazatomprom and the Kazakh National Nuclear Centre (NNC). A reduced-power model, Guinevere, became operational at Mol in March 2010.</p>
<p>In mid-2006 the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) was commissioned by the government to develop two types of fast neutron reactors which are essentially Generation IV designs: an improved version of the sodium-cooled type (SFR) which already has 45 reactor-years operational experience in France, and an innovative gas-cooled type. Both would have fuel recycling. The 600 MWe sodium-cooled prototype at Marcoule, Astrid (Advanced Sodium Technological Reactor for Industrial Demonstration), is a high priority in R&amp;D on account of its actinide-burning potential. The CEA is seeking support under the EC's European Sustainable Nuclear Industrial Initiative and partnerships with Japan and China to develop Astrid, which will have great flexibility in breeding ratios. In May 2014 Japan committed to support Astrid development. Allegro is the second line of French-led FNR development &ndash; also an EU Euratom project under ESNII. This is a gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR). A 50-100 MWt experimental version is envisaged by 2025.</p>
<p>At Russia&rsquo;s Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (RIAR or NIIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Rosatom is setting up an International Research Centre (IRC) based on its planned multi-purpose fast neutron research reactor (MBIR) and is inviting international participation. The full MBIR research complex is now budgeted at $1 billion, with the Russian budget already having provided $300 million from the federal target program. Pre-construction shares of 1% are being offered for $10 million, allowing involvement in detailed design of irradiation facilities. RIAR will be the legal owner of MBIR, performing operational and administrative functions, while the International Research Centre will be the legal entity responsible for marketing and research management.</p>
<p>At the Shanghai Institute of Nuclear Applied Physics (SINAP, under the China Academy of Science) the thorium-breeding molten-salt reactors (TMSR) Research Centre has a 5 MW solid-fuel MSR prototype under construction at Shanghai Institute of Nuclear Applied Physics (SINAP, under the Academy) with 2015 target for operation. This is also known as the fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR) in Generation IV parlance, or Advanced HTR (AHTR). The US Department of Energy (especially Oak Ridge NL) is collaborating with the Academy on the program, which had a start-up budget of $350 million.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Power Institute of China (NPIC) has an agreement with Candu Energy (Canada), the Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Company (TQNPC), and China North Nuclear Fuel Corporation to develop technology for recycling uranium recovered from used nuclear fuel from other Chinese reactors (PWRs) with up to 1.6% fissile content for use in the Qinshan Phase III Candu units. In 2012 this focused on undertaking a detailed conceptual design of the Advanced Fuel Candu Reactor (AFCR), which is described as &ldquo;a further evolution of the successful Candu 6 and Generation III Enhanced Candu 6 (EC6), optimized for use of recycled uranium and thorium fuel&rdquo;. At the completion of the agreement in 2014, the parties &ldquo;expect to have the basis of a pre-project agreement for two AFCR units in China, including site allocation and the definition of the licensing basis.&rdquo; A July 2009 agreement among these four parties is to jointly develop and demonstrate the use of thorium fuel and to study the commercial and technical feasibility of its full-scale use in Candu units such as at Qinshan.</p>
<p><em>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION &ndash; NATIONAL-BASED</em></p>
<p>The Agency France Nuclear International (AFNI) under the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) provides a vehicle for international assistance.&nbsp;Its purpose is to help to set up structures and systems to enable the establishment of civil nuclear programs in countries wanting to develop them and will draw on all of France&rsquo;s expertise in this. It is guided by a steering committee comprising representatives of all the ministries involved (Energy, Foreign affairs, Industry, Research, etc) as well as representatives of other major French nuclear institutions including the CEA itself. Its work will be confined to countries with which France has signed a nuclear cooperation agreement, and the initial focus is on UAE. Poland is a further field of interest. It will function on a fee for service basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The JAIF International Cooperation Center (JICC) was established by the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum (JAIF) in March 2009 to provide a one-stop service to countries planning to introduce nuclear power, primarily to help them develop their infrastructure in such area as human resources, financing and legal structures. JICC provides cooperation and assistance, supported by government subsidies, to countries that have concluded agreements with the Japanese government on cooperation in the nuclear area. As of fiscal 2009, those countries are Vietnam, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kazakhstan. JICC coordinates the integrated efforts taken by the Japanese government, industry, and academic world toward that end.</p>
