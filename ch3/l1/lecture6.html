<center><p><strong>Lecture 6. The nuclear policy of states as a factor of international conflicts escalation</strong></p></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, nuclear policies of states that are only starting to develop their nuclear sector are as much of a threat to peaceful international relations as those of states with a long history of nuclear development both in the energy and armaments sphere. Policy-making decisions of states with nuclear development threaten to affect the entire world community and global international relations.</p>
<p>Eliminating nuclear threats is a matter of necessity, not choice. The world&rsquo;s 23,000 nuclear weapons &ndash; many still deployed on high alert &ndash; can destroy life on this planet many times over. That the horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has not so far been repeated owes far more to luck than to good policy management.</p>
<p>Even with the U.S. and Russia showing welcome new leadership, the policy challenges are immense. Every state with nuclear weapons has to be persuaded to give them up. States without nuclear weapons have to neither want nor be able to acquire them. Terrorists must be stopped from getting anywhere near them. And rapidly expanding peaceful nuclear energy use must be security risk-free.</p>
<p>Seven story lines are advancing along crooked paths, each undermining the existing nuclear order. These comprise North Korea's expanding nuclear weapons program, Iran's continuing nuclear ambitions, and Pakistan&rsquo;s increasing instability, al Qaeda&rsquo;s enduring remnant, growing cynicism about the nonproliferation regime, nuclear energy&rsquo;s renaissance, and the recent learning of lessons about the utility of nuclear weapons in international affairs.</p>
<p>Most of the foreign policy community has still not absorbed the facts about North Korean developments over the past eight years. One of the poorest and most isolated states on earth, North Korea had at most two bombs' worth of plutonium in 2001. Today, it has an arsenal of ten bombs and has conducted two nuclear weapons tests. It is currently harvesting the plutonium for an 11th bomb and restoring its reactor in Yongbyon, which has the capacity to produce a further two bombs&rsquo; worth of plutonium a year. In addition, Pyongyang has repeatedly tested long-range missiles that are increasingly reliable, has proliferated nuclear technologies (including the sale of a Yongbyon-style reactor to Syria), and may be developing a second path to nuclear weapons by building a facility to enrich uranium.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the nuclear nonproliferation regime, two questions jump off the page. First, does Kim Jong II imagine that he could get away with selling a nuclear weapon to Osama bin Laden or Iran? The fact that he sold Syria a plutonium-producing reactor suggests that he does. Second, what are the consequences for the NPT if one of the world&rsquo;s weakest states can violate the rules of the regime with impunity and defy the demands of the strongest states, which are those that are charged with its enforcement?</p>
<p>Already, North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear advances have triggered reﬂections in Seoul, Tokyo, and other regional capitals about options that were previously considered taboo. Although Japan&rsquo;s political culture is unambiguously against nuclear weapons, in 2002 then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi demonstrated how quickly that could change when he observed publicly, &ldquo;It is significant that although we could have them, we don&rsquo;t&rdquo; and because Japan has a ready stockpile of nearly 2000 kilograms of highly enriched uranium and a well-developed missile program (for launching satellites), if Tokyo were to conclude that it required a credible nuclear deterrent of its own, it could adopt a serious nuclear weapons posture virtually overnight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iran's nuclear odyssey is a moving target. Developments in the current negotiations may offer glimmers of hope. But it is unlikely that Iran will prove less obstinate and devious than North Korea has been. All the evidence suggests that Iran is methodically building up a widely dispersed array of mining, uranium-conversion, and uranium-enrichment facilities that could provide the infrastructure for nuclear weapons. At this point, it has mastered the technologies to indigenously manufacture, build, and operate its own centrifuges. Already, Iran is spinning 4500 centrifuges, which produce an average of six pounds of low-enriched uranium per day, and has installed an additional 3700 centrifuges that are ready to begin operation. The country now has a stockpile of over 3000 pounds of low-enriched uranium -- enough, after further enrichment, to make two Hiroshima-type nuclear bombs. Moreover, as the outing of a previously secret enrichment facility at Qom makes evident, Iran has thought carefully about the threat of a military strike on its declared facility at Natanz. To hedge against that risk, it has likely constructed more than one covert enrichment plant -- facilities that would also provide a potential sneak-out option.</p>
<p>The tone throughout is analytical, measured and hard-headedly realistic. But the ultimate ideal is never lost sight of: so long as any nuclear weapons remain, the world can never be safe.</p>
<p>The nuclear policy of Iran can be used as an illustrative example. Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program unfolded in context of its overall politics. Since the 1979 revolution, Iran&rsquo;s political elite has long been divided over how the theocracy should evolve and what international role it should pursue. Beyond broad concepts, such as independence, self-reliance and social justice, consensus has proven elusive&mdash;even three decades after the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s birth. The most fundament difference is whether Iran should continue as a revolutionary state willing to defy the world, or whether it should settle down and become a normal state that plays by international rules. The nuclear issue is increasingly a reflection of this basic division.</p>
<p>Throughout the program&rsquo;s early stages, there appeared to be a general consensus among the political elite about the need or right to proceed. But by 2005, the consensus appeared to be crumbling. Rival factions in Iran&rsquo;s political labyrinth began to criticize the nuclear program&rsquo;s costs and centrality to Iran&rsquo;s development goals. Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program had become a domestic political football.</p>
<p>For the public, the nuclear program also initially enjoyed broad popular support since it promised energy independence and scientific progress. It was also popular because the regime depicted it as an assertion of Iran&rsquo;s rights against foreign arrogance. But the program has not been subjected to informed debate or public discussion about its ultimate goals, the costs, and the relationship with Iran&rsquo;s other objectives. Consensus ends where specifics begin.</p>
<p>The nuclear program has evolved through three phases:</p>
<p>Phase one: Period of consensus 1987-2002 - The period of maximum consensus on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program spanned 15 years. The revival of the shah&rsquo;s nuclear program was initially presented as necessary to diversify energy sources. Nuclear technology was equated as cutting edge for development and indispensable for any self-respecting power.</p>
<p>But the regime only presented a rationale for energy; it did not acknowledge whatever weapons intentions it had. The program progressed slowly during this phase, as Iran encountered problems of organization and getting access to technology that had to be acquired clandestinely abroad. The United States, already wary of Iran&rsquo;s weapons intentions, sought to block its access to any nuclear technology. Ironically, the regime may have received a boost from blanket U.S. opposition, which extended to the construction of a light-water reactor at Bushehr that Washington had approved when the shah was in power. Iran&rsquo;s attempts to evade international opposition&mdash;which included purchases from the Pakistan network run by A.Q. Khan&mdash;were never discussed domestically.</p>
<p>Phase two: Early controversy 2003-2005 - Throughout this period, the nuclear program was largely a concern of Iran&rsquo;s political elites. The Supreme National Security Council technically acted as the body that reflected all political tendencies. Its decisions therefore allegedly reflected a national consensus.</p>
<p>The 2002 revelation about Iran&rsquo;s construction of an undeclared enrichment facility at Natanz put Tehran on the defensive. The disclosure coincided with U.S. concern about the spread of weapons of mass destruction to rogue regimes and extremist networks. To avoid exacerbating the issue, the reformist government of President Mohammad Khatami won agreement in the Supreme National Security Council to meet international concerns halfway. Iran agreed to apply the NPT&rsquo;s Additional Protocol &ndash; without ratifying it&mdash;which permitted stricter international inspections. It also agreed to voluntarily suspend enrichment for a limited though unspecified time.</p>
<p>Iran&rsquo;s ensuing negotiations with Britain, France and Germany proved unproductive and added to mutual suspicions. With the U.S. military preoccupied in Iraq, the threat of military action against Iran receded. But hardliners who gained control of Iran&rsquo;s parliament in 2004 began criticizing reformists for being too soft on the United States for compromising Iran&rsquo;s interests. In 2005, newly elected President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, backed by Iran&rsquo;s supreme leader, began enriching uranium again. The deal with the Europeans was dead.</p>
<p>Phase three: Deep divisions 2005-2010 - Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program became increasingly political during this phase. As of 2005, both the executive branch and parliament were dominated by hardliners and conservatives. Both Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei used the nuclear issue to stigmatize reformists, depicting them as defeatists willing to negotiate away Iran&rsquo;s interests. Their use of the nuclear issue as an instrument of partisan politics ended the phase when the nuclear program was supposed to be a national issue. And debate was actively discouraged.</p>
<p>Yet the nuclear issue gradually slipped from the hands of the elite to the street. Among hardliners, Ahmadinejad&rsquo;s populist rallies included frequently orchestrated chants in favor of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear rights. The president announced that Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program was &ldquo;like a train without brakes,&rdquo; not susceptible to deflection by outside pressure. Slogans, stamps, banknotes and medals became substitutes for informed discussion.</p>
<p>Two factors spurred intense backlash&mdash;and a reaction on the other side of the street. First, the United Nations imposed a series of U.N. resolutions between 2006 and 2010 that included punitive sanctions. The United States and the European Union imposed even tougher unilateral sanctions. For the Iranian public, the costs of continued defiance became increasingly clear&mdash;and complicated daily life.</p>
<p>Second, Iran&rsquo;s disputed 2009 election&mdash;won by Ahmadinejad amid widespread allegations of fraud&mdash;sparked the largest protests against the regime since the 1979 revolution. A new Green Movement opposition was born. Many conservatives also had growing concerns about the populist hard-line president, particularly his economic mismanagement. Iran&rsquo;s new political chasm quickly began to play on the nuclear issue. Four months after the election, Ahmadinejad agreed to a U.S.-backed interim agreement designed to ease tensions and open the way for broader negotiations on Iran&rsquo;s long-term program. Leaders of the Green Movement as well as key conservatives publicly criticized the deal&mdash;reportedly in large part just to oppose Ahmadinejad and prevent him from taking credit for ending tensions with the outside world. Iran soon walked away from the deal.</p>
<p>By 2010, the divide over Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program had more to do with domestic politics&mdash;and very little to do with what many of the key players actually wanted to see happen.</p>
<p>The future perspectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program, always vague, is likely to become even more politicized. The weapons component of the program has never been debated or acknowledged and further revelations or costs associated with it could make it more controversial. Since 2009, factions take positions that do not reflect their real preferences, mainly to thwart political rivals.</li>
<li>Increased international pressure and sanctions are likely to increase the program&rsquo;s costs, which is also likely to make the program more contentious at home &ndash; and potentially exacerbate existing political differences in the leadership.</li>
<li>Iran&rsquo;s hard-line default position&mdash;to negotiate only under the most severe pressure&mdash;has been reinforced by the change in the domestic balance of power. The Revolutionary Guards are now a principal player in decision-making.</li>
<li>A wild card is the possibility of an Israeli or U.S. military strike on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear facilities; the repercussions are unpredictable. A reasonable assumption is that initially Iranians may rally around the flag and hardliners will try to further consolidate their position by purging the moderates. The regime will also see its rationale for a weapons option reinforced, and may shift to an overt weapons program and even leave the NPT. Once the dust settles, however, the domestic backlash to an attack may discredit the regime for its brinksmanship and intransigence.</li>
<li>Iran&rsquo;s technical progress is uneven and allows time for more diplomacy. Any compromise agreement will need to find a balance between not rewarding Iran&rsquo;s confrontational policies while also meeting Tehran&rsquo;s minimal political needs in order to win domestic support for an agreement. This may be harder than it sounds.</li>
