<center><p><strong>Lecture 1. The role of nuclear energy in ensuring energy security of the states (with the example of Asia-Pacific states)</strong></p></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 20<sup>th</sup> Century is called the age of oil. It may be no exaggeration to say that the energy policies of the major advanced nations of the world have been virtually built around oil. Like a giant ship that is difficult to steer, long-term energy policies and the energy supply infrastructure based on these policies cannot be altered significantly even when the energy situation changes.</p>
<p>Nuclear power generation is similarly entrenched. It involves a very large industrial infrastructure, which includes mines, fuel processing, spent fuel storage, reprocessing, and waste disposal. Moreover, research and development requires huge investments and a long lead-time. So, once established, nuclear power generation is very hard to alter. This aspect has a most significant meaning in considering the role that nuclear power generation plays in energy security.</p>
<p>As of the end of 1998, there were 422 commercial nuclear power generation plants (358.49 kW) in operation in the world, accounting for about 16% of the world's electricity supply. However, it is expected that the number of new projects in North America and Europe will decline as plans for abolishing or early closure of nuclear power plants are increasing. This trend implies that nuclear power generation may be expected to have a smaller share in world electricity markets in the years to come.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Northeast Asia is the only region where nuclear power is expected to grow. Northeast Asian countries continue to pursue nuclear power generation to enhance energy security in the face of dwindling regional oil supplies. Since the oil crises of the 1970&rsquo;s, nuclear power generation has been playing a major role as an alternative energy, but there are many problems yet to be resolved for nuclear power generation to continue to contribute to energy security.</p>
<p>First, it should be recognized that many of the problems facing the nuclear power industry come from past policy decisions. In particular, the problems of spent fuel and radioactive waste are greatly affected by the decisions regarding the nuclear fuel cycle and the fast breeder reactors (FBR).</p>
<p>Second, as exemplified by the Chernobyl accident in the former Soviet Union and the critical accident in Tokai Village and Fukushima prefecture in Japan, such accidents, even one involving a small part of the system, can seriously affect the fate of other nuclear power projects. Such accidents affect social attitudes towards nuclear power, even spreading across national borders. Therefore, sufficient attention should be given to the technical risks and the effects they pose.</p>
<p>Lastly and perhaps most importantly, nuclear power&rsquo;s image is linked to its relationship with nuclear weapons. Nuclear power programs for civilian and military use are given clear distinction by law, but it is more difficult to give them technical distinction. The use and reprocessing of plutonium have posed the greatest danger of being employed for nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The energy environment for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century is very opaque and uncertain. How can we cope with this uncertainty? What future role will nuclear power play? To answer these questions, it is necessary to weigh nuclear power&rsquo;s role as a relatively secure alternative to fossil fuels against its technical risks, lack of public acceptance and potential security role.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Europe account for two thirds of the world's nuclear power capacity. Considering future growth of nuclear power generation, it is certain that the largest share of the world's total nuclear power capacities will shift to Asia. According to a recent survey, Asia accounts for less than 20% of the existing capacity, but about one third of the 46 nuclear power plants (38 million kWh) under construction and about 60% of the planned 46 nuclear power plants (34.49 million kWh) are located in Asia. Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan account for 90% of the planned capacity increase in Asia. Will nuclear power in Asia really grow as expected? It surely will grow, but it may fail to materialize at the levels currently predicted.</p>
<p><u>China: Downward revision of the nuclear power plans and safety </u></p>
<p>To meet its rapidly growing energy demand, China, as the most populous nation in Asia, is expected to shift some of its energy sources from coal to nuclear power. Currently, a total of 12 nuclear power plants (10.7 million kWh) are under construction or are planned in China. This is the largest capacity in the world, exceeding that of Russia (11 plants, 8.96 million kWh) and of India (16 plants, 6.76 million kWh).</p>
<p>In June 1998, construction began on the No. 1 reactor of phase three of Tai Shan nuclear power plant to be built by AECL of Canada as the main contractor. This, along with the FRAMATOME reactor in Canton province and the Russian PWR (VVER-1000) in Shandong province, highlights the diversity of nuclear reactors China imports. In the future, China is planning to pursue the development of the PWR on its own.</p>
<p>Given these programs, China has the most promising prospects for nuclear power growth in Asia, but it is likely that given capital constraints, China will make a downward revision of its nuclear power development plans.</p>
<p>It was rumored that China National Economic Committee was going to review China&rsquo;s ninth five-year electric power development plan and also scale down its nuclear power development plan. China&rsquo;s electricity demand is growing at a low rate of 2.5% per year, with the GDP elasticity down to 0.53 from 0.81 in 1995. Its nuclear power development plan aiming at 20 million kWh in 2010 is considered difficult to achieve since only three power plants (2.26 million kWh) have been completed up to now. It is also believed that investment in modernization of China&rsquo;s power transmission lines deserves a higher priority than new generation capacity. It has been decided to break up the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), which has been the central body for nuclear power development. Now that efficient management of the electric power business is considered important as a policy matter, it is fairly likely that China&rsquo;s investment in nuclear power generation will not go as smoothly as planned.</p>
<p>New information indicates that the July 1998 accident at the Tai Shan No.1 reactor was more serious than originally thought. Designed and built by China, this reactor has been suspended since last July, but the details of the accident have not been made public. According to a recent announcement, insufficient strength in the guidelines fitted to the lower part of the reactor for inserting the neutron sensor is considered to be responsible for the accident. It is said that 24 fitting bolts and nuts came off with the 24 guidelines or were otherwise damaged. These collided with one another and damaged nine of the 121 pieces of the nuclear fuel assembly. The report confirmed no radioactive leakage from the reactor, but the damage, if left as is, would get worse causing a critical situation.</p>
<p>Almost nothing has been made known about this accident. The China National Security Agency admits that the accident occurred. But other information has not been publicly released; it has never made any of the details known. It appears that MITI has some information on this accident through an information exchange agreement between the Chinese and Japanese nuclear authorities concerned, but details have not been disclosed to MITI as yet. With the Chernobyl accident, Russia learned that releasing information about the accident and quickly propagating was an important element in the process. The way China responded to its accident has left fears about the future of its nuclear power program.</p>
<p><u>Korea and Taiwan: Privatization and spent fuel disposal as vexing issues </u></p>
<p>South Korea&rsquo;s nuclear power development has so far been proceeding quite smoothly. Its nuclear power generation as of 1998 is up as much as 16.3% to a record high of 89.7 billion kWh.</p>
<p>However, the recent economic crisis makes the future of the nuclear power industry uncertain. The Korean government (the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Resources) in August 1998 announced the electric power development plan for its nuclear power for the years up to 2015. The nuclear power development plan was scaled down due to Korea&rsquo;s flat electricity demand projections. The 1995 plan called for 27 power plants (26.329 million kWh) to be completed by 2010 whereas the current plan aims at 25 plants (23.429 million kWh). It has also been decided to privatize Korea Electric Power Corporation and embark on a major restructuring of the electric power industry.</p>
<p>Nuclear power accounts for 41.7% of Taiwan&rsquo;s total power generation, up 9.4% from the previous year. The result so far is excellent, with the average utilization at 90.2%.</p>
<p>Prior to 1996, Taiwan&rsquo;s nuclear power share has been declining, from 24.5% in 1994 to 21.7% in 1996. To help increase nuclear power's share, Taiwan Electric has decided to build in Long Men, the site of its fourth nuclear reactor, two of the ABWR (1.35 million kwh) of Tokyo Electric&rsquo;s Kashiwazaki/Kariha type. Construction of the first reactor started in 1999 and operation is scheduled to commence in 2004. The second reactor is expected to be in operation in 2025. With its 1999 IPO, Taiwan Electric is to be fully privatized by June 2001. With a $15 billion capitalization, this privatization will be the largest among a series for state-owned companies in telecommunications and oil. Taiwan Electric Power will be split into power generation, power transmission, and power distribution divisions. This desegregation would greatly affect Taiwan's electric power policies and nuclear power for years to come.</p>
<p>The Korean and Taiwanese state-owned electric power companies that underpinned Asia&rsquo;s nuclear power development efforts are undergoing big changes. The trend will surely be to emphasize short-term profitability, making it harder to secure long-term investment funds required for the development of nuclear power development. A major unresolved issue for the two countries is nuclear waste and spent fuel.</p>
<p>South Korea had a low-level and a medium-level waste disposal plant that was planned at Anmyondo and Myongdo. Both were cancelled. The plant in Anmyondo was cancelled in 1990 due to local opposition, and the facility in Myongdo was cancelled in 1995 because of an active fault discovered near the island. Subsequently, it was decided that the oversight responsibility for nuclear energy would shift from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) to the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Resources (MOCIR). At the same time, it was also decided to shift the responsibility for radioactive waste disposal from the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) to the Korean Electric Power Company.</p>
<p>As of June 1998, Korea had 50,215 pieces of low and medium-level waste stored at nuclear power plants. This is expected to reach 98,048 pieces in 2010, 177,278 in 2025, and 257,078 in 2040. With the power plants storage capacity of less than 100,000 pieces, a quick response is necessary.</p>
<p>Spent fuel, which now totals 3,365 tons in South Korea, is expected to reach 4,632 tons in 2000, 11,083 tons in 2010, 23,389 tons in 2025, and 34,102 tons in 2040. With a power plant site storage capacity of only 6,589 tons, it is said that new capacity separate from the power plant sites is needed.</p>
<p>In September 1998, the MOCIR announced a new plan for low-level waste disposal plants and spent fuel storage facilities. The first phase of the plan calls for a 100,000-piece low-level processing plant and a 2,000-ton spent fuel storage facility, which will eventually be expanded to 800,000 pieces and 20,000 tons respectively.</p>
<p>Nuclear waste disposal is an issue in Taiwan as well. In particular, the agreement with North Korea to cooperate on low-level wastes is foundering for political reasons. In February 1998, Taiwan Electric Power selected six locations out of the 30 candidate sites for low-level waste disposal. In March, the Atomic Power Commission announced the &ldquo;Declaration of Safe Management of Low-level Radioactive Wastes&rdquo; which focuses on ensuring security, mandating Taiwan Electric Power to submit environmental and safety assessment reports.</p>
<p><u>Other Countries: India, Pakistan, North Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam </u></p>
<p>Nuclear power in Asia cannot be discussed without addressing the issues of North Korea and nuclear proliferation on the subcontinent.</p>
<p>The nuclear testing by India and Pakistan in May 1998 renewed nuclear fears of the Cold War era. In June 1998, India signed an agreement to import two VVER-1000 reactors from Russia. Pakistan&rsquo;s Chasnupp power plant (PWR, 325Mwe) supplied by China&rsquo;s CNNC is expected to commenced operations during 1999.</p>
<p>The Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea, North Korea, is suspected of having nuclear weapons. The light water reactor project of KEDO (Korean Peninsular Energy Development Organization) was agreed to in June 1998 with the condition that North Korea suspend its nuclear weapons program and the offered price of the two reactors is to be reduced from $5,18 billion to $4.6 billion. It was also agreed that Korea and Japan would shoulder $3.2 billion and $10 billion respectively. But, several issues with North Korea remain unresolved. These include rapidly changing development and instability such as the test firing of missiles, suspicious ships on the Japan Sea, and secret underground facilities.</p>
<p>Indonesia should also be mentioned as a country in Southeast Asia that has been pursuing nuclear power aggressively. Vietnam is also said to have begun discussing nuclear power for its future energy program. Indonesia completed feasibility studies to embark on nuclear power several years ago, but the financial crisis and political instability have delayed implementation. Also, the discovery of rich natural gas resources and the liberalization of the electric power business may have contributed to cooling of nuclear power prospects. Orders of nuclear power equipment are unlikely. Vietnam too completed nuclear power feasibility studies in November 1998. The country&rsquo;s electricity demand is forecast to increase to between 140 billion and 180 billion kWh by 2020. With Vietnam&rsquo;s conventional electric power sources (coal, gas, and hydropower) considered to be capable of only 100 billion kWh, the country may consider development of about 20 billion kWh of nuclear power to help reduce its dependence on imported electricity. This would require nuclear power generation capacity of 3 million kWh, for which Vietnam is expected to put the necessary facilities in place between 2010 and 2020.</p>
