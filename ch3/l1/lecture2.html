<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huntington considered that: &ldquo;World politics is entering a new phase, and intellectuals have not hesitated to proliferate visions of what it will be &ndash; the end of history, the return of traditional rivalries between nation states, and the decline of the nation state from the conflicting pulls of tribalism and globalism, among others. Each of these visions catches aspects of the emerging reality. Yet they all miss a crucial, indeed a central, aspect of global politics is likely to be in the coming years&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But not only cultural aspects in global international affairs are stepping forward. It is evident that the contemporary world also has other complex issues concerning the course of international relations and the development of certain policies. One of the main aspects that affect the changes in economic and foreign policies are the technogenic factors, which have rapidly developed and integrated into everyday lives not only of ordinary people, but of countries as a whole.</p>
<p>In addition to that technology and technology induced factors themselves are beginning to be guided by outside forces, since their development created a vicious circle, where the development of technogenic factors leads to environmental changes, which, in their turn, have a critical effect on the reasoning for further progress of technology, especially in the light of technogenic catastrophes driven by frequenting natural disasters.</p>
<p>According to Ajay Chhibber and RachidLaajaj &ldquo;worldwide, the risks linked to natural hazards have increased sharply in recent years, with the number of recorded natural disasters having increased exponentially from around 50 per year in the early 1970&rsquo;s, to almost 400 per year in 2005. In constant dollars, the costs of natural disasters between 1996 and 2005 reached over $650 billion in material losses, which is more than 15 times higher than the cost from 1950 to 1959. Over this period some 2 billion people were affected by disasters in one way or another. Natural hazards are an increasing hindrance to the development of the many developing countries, and need to be addressed. How much of the growing vulnerability to disasters is due to human actions and how much due to nature has been a subject of some debate. One part of researchers argues that hazards are created by nature but disasters are largely technogenic and that development and disasters are closely interlinked. Moreover, while much focus is placed on very visible cataclysmic events such as earthquakes, floods and tsunamis, we must become more aware that disasters are also often the slow buildup of human pressure on resources leading to natural resource degradation and increased frequency of disasters such as floods or famines. And while many disasters are considered a product of under-development many are also the result of choices made on development strategies.</p>
<p>What is striking also is the picture by disaster types with huge increase in two types of disasters: flood and wind storm (including hurricanes, typhoons). The frequency of natural disasters caused by other categories, earthquakes, volcano, slides, and pest-infestation has not changed markedly, although there is a small but perceptible increase in droughts. How much of this recorded increase is due to better reporting, how much is due to real natural activity is still a subject of debate. The shift of population into more disaster-prone areas could be one reason for more recorded natural disasters. More worrisome is the hypothesis that one manifestation of climate change is an increase in the frequency of natural disasters especially floods and wind storms as they are related to temperature changes in the oceans. Broadly natural disasters are classified into two categories: hydro-metrological and volcanic with a marked increase in the former category, although recent news media has focused considerably on earthquakes in Pakistan, and Sumatra (which caused the Tsunami) as well as in Java. But recent floods in Mexico, South Asia, typhoon activity in the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea affecting Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines, Taiwan (China) and China all are examples of increased hydro-metrological phenomenon&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Windstorm activity which shows a marked increase causes damage from flooding but also from wind activity itself. The marked increase in this type of disaster has been linked to increases in ocean temperature which is alleged to increase the intensity of wind storms and thereby increase their destructive power. Category 4 and 5 windstorms have been increasing over the last decade. Their destructive power has also increased because of shifts in the concentration of population to the coastal areas and because of indiscriminate coastal development and loss of natural protection from mangroves. Sea level rise is also a major factor in coastal erosion. Part of the sea level rise is attributed to melting ice caps and part of it is due to an increase in the oceanic temperature itself. The increase in flooding is also a hydro-metrological phenomenon but is also linked to human developmental actions such as deforestation, and peri-urban settlement in areas without adequate drainage or in areas which were kept open for normal drainage, but were subsequently taken over for settlement by migrants with nowhere else to live.</p>
<p>But one cannot simply consider the sort-term and long-term effects of all the more frequent natural disasters, regardless whether they were man-inflicted or destroyed the results of technological development, in the light of their impact only on the country that was damaged by the resister, but understand that the impact will expand to neighboring countries, less often regions and sometimes, depending on the damage assessment, even the whole world.</p>
<p>In addition, Ajay Chhibber and RachidLaajaj note that &ldquo;there is also growing evidence that there are links between conflict, security and disasters, with the pressure on resources often leading to the increased probability of conflict. While much focus has been on the scramble for natural assets, be they oil, diamonds, forests as source of conflict, we have seen conflict and insecurity also arise from the slow build-up of disasters coming from lack of resources and sometimes from the increased vulnerability created following a disaster. This is evident in some of the conflicts in Central Africa and more recently in the Darfur region of the Sudan where the rebellion began in the 1970&rsquo;s, right after Africa&rsquo;s greatest famine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Therefore, need to take a much more comprehensive link between disasters, security and economic development is becoming more prominent by the day. This leads to the understanding of the necessity to comprehend all the possibilities of the development of this link, the impact of such an understanding on the policies of international actors and gradually point out the interconnection linked disasters, security and economic development with the policies concerning the development of technologies and international decisions and relations, based on this progress.</p>
<p>The links between economic development and vulnerability to natural hazard should be researched in order to better understand the factors that need to be addressed to help countries get better prepared to deal with natural disasters as well as to better understand how choices made on development policies affect vulnerability to disasters.</p>
<p>And consequently the effect that vulnerability to disasters has on the changes in the post-disaster policies, leading to the changes in the general policies of some countries, which may result in radical changes in the tendencies of international relations in some particular regions or even on a world-wide scale. Considering the fact that while it is easier to understand the short-term impact of natural disasters the long-term economic impact of natural disasters remains uncertain. Such uncertainty is at times the reason for unwise steps in editing policies, since there is no opportunity to predict every possible outcome of the long-term effects of a disaster that may turn out to be a technogenic catastrophe.</p>
<p>It is evident that technology has a great impact on environment, and this effect is becoming more and more threateningly prominent by the day. Still, the development of humanity and the technological and scientific progress are processes that have gone past the point of no return, that is to say that there is now no possible way of stopping their escalating progress. Moreover, the progress of technology in closely connected with all economic and political processes in the world, indicating that a technogenic factor, if combined with a natural disaster, will become a radical factor in the future economic and political development of more than one country or region, depending on the damage scale of the catastrophe.</p>
<p>Several studies have evaluated the short-term cost of natural disasters. An exhaustive assessment of the short-term costs must include both direct costs (damage to buildings, crops, social infrastructure) and indirect costs (lost output and investment, macroeconomic imbalances, increased indebtedness). The World Bank estimated that from 1990 to 2000, natural disasters have caused damage representing between 2 to 15 percent of an exposed country&rsquo;s annual GDP (World Bank 2004). With such large costs&mdash;in many countries much larger than their aid budgets, and in some cases larger than the country&rsquo;s investment rate&mdash;it is important to focus, more than has been the case so far, on the impact of natural disasters, their relationship to economic development priorities and strategy, and better coping mechanisms.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that most natural disasters have severe short-term consequences on the economy and cause tremendous human suffering. Over the last several years&rsquo; horrendous loss of life and suffering occurred in Pakistan from the Kashmir earthquakes, in Indonesia, Thailand and parts of South Asia from the Tsunami cause by a quake off Sumatra, from Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana and from repeated stories of flooding in South Asia, Vietnam, Mexico and Central America. The costs of human life, capital and economic losses from large and small disasters are huge and if avoidable could lead to large welfare gains. For this reason alone, it would be important to study ways in which the short-term impact of natural disasters could be reduced. But it seems even more important if we can demonstrate that natural disasters have long-term impact. Decisions on how to cope with natural disasters can have consequences over long periods and into future generations. But very few studies assess the long term-consequences of natural hazards.</p>
<p>Because natural disasters are frequently succeeded by higher growth rates which seem to compensate for the economic impact of the disaster, one could expect that disasters are just a temporary disruption of the development process that has no impact on the long-term development of the country. Aghion and Howitt (1998) provide a theoretical explanation to this observation with a Schumpeterian model of endogenous growth. In the model, growth is generated by technological change that is embedded in new capital replacement needed after the disaster. As a result, a natural disaster can even lead to a positive overall impact on the economy.</p>
<p>Some authors have tried to model the long-term effects of disasters. Using arguments on economic linkage and substitution effects, Albala-Bertrand (1993) constructed the first macroeconomic model of the economic impact of a natural disaster. In this model, a first step was to set an upper limit for the impact of a one-time disaster on output, assuming that all losses are to capital stocks, which is homogenous and irreplaceable in the short term.</p>
<p>The result is basically that the reduction in the output is proportional to the reduction in the stock of capital. The author then modifies some assumptions, considering for example that loss is split between capital and output, that capital loss is estimated at replacement cost, and that capital is heterogeneous. As a result, the author finds a much smaller impact on output and he considers this to be much more realistic than the first result. The implication is that a natural disaster is unlikely to have a long-term impact on growth. It explained why macroeconomic indicators improved during the years following the disaster and quickly returned to their normal level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benson and Clay (2004) come to the opposite conclusion by arguing that resources used following a disaster are not necessarily additional and can have a high opportunity cost. The authors provide a number of channels through which natural hazard can influence the path of growth and development: the stock of capital and human resources can be damaged (through migration and death) or their productivity reduced by disruption of infrastructure and markets; increase in spending can lead to higher fiscal deficits and cause inflation; reallocation of expenditures draws funds from planned investments; even when funded by aid, this aid may not be entirely additional: donors tend to advance commitments within existing multiyear country programs and budget envelopes. As a result, the amount of aid provided following the natural disaster is also diverted from development aid flows; consecutive natural disasters create an atmosphere of uncertainty that discourages potential investors&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But the damage and both long-term and short-term effects of natural disasters are known to become grossly higher if the disaster itself triggers a catastrophe caused by technogenic factors. There have been several examples of such occurrences, but the most recent and frightening tragedy caused by the tsunami and earthquake based technogenic accident on the Japanese nuclear power station Fukushima Daiichi is one of the more illustrative of the fact that collaboration of technogenic factors with natural disasters increases the damage and casualties by several times. In this case short-term effects turned out to be much more radical a damaging, since the accident resulted not only in a great number of deaths caused be the natural hazard, but also the panic in both economic and social spheres. And if the social global problem of technogenic and nuclear safety that arose as a result of the meltdown of Fukushima Daiichi reactors could be solved by at least a blockade for Japanese export, the panic in the financial sector threatened to overthrow the entire economic system of the world.</p>
<p>A common problem in preparing an economic assessment following a disaster is the confusion caused by mixing stock losses with changes in flows. A distinction is necessary between the impact of the disaster on stocks and flows. Physical and human capital and public debt are examples of such stocks; which can be affected directly (destruction of infrastructure, livestock) or indirectly, in this latter case the variation of a flow causes the variation of the corresponding stock. An increase in the public deficit would help add to the public debt; or a diversion of investments to fund the relief costs would reduce the stock of physical capital. In return, annual flows are dependent on stocks: physical and human capital stocks are determinants of the GDP. These multiple and complex interactions need to be considered for an evaluation of the economic impact of a disaster.</p>
<p>Still the impact of technogenic factors on the development of economic and political views of different states as well as any bilateral or multilateral relations should not only be considered from the side that arises from the consequences of natural or man-made disasters, but also from the side of safe development of technology and its influence on internal and external policies of states. The desire of Asia for constructing new nuclear power stations can be used as an example.</p>
<p>With the nuclear pendulum having swung firmly back in its favor globally, the talk in much of Asia is now no longer whether to include nuclear power into the generation mix, but how and when to do so. With many Asian economies continuing to see significant economic growth from industrialization and urbanization, the combined concerns of global warming and economic loss due to air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels, have provided the catalyst for development of a nuclear power program.</p>
<p>However, commissioning new nuclear has its challenges, and not least is the challenge of successfully procuring and erecting nuclear power stations in new nuclear countries with a developing regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Japan, South Korea, India and China already operate a large proportion of the world's nuclear reactor fleet and are rapidly building more. Further, Japanese, Chinese and South Korean vendors and contractors are already active around the world in the nuclear sector. Other emerging Asian countries (including Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand) have included at least one new nuclear plant in their medium to longer term power planning programs.</p>
<p>These programs are themselves supported by bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding with many countries including South Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Russian and French interested entities.</p>
<p>In seeking out export markets Chinese, South Korean and Japanese vendors need to be mindful of a range of challenges that could potentially hamper the roll out of, particularly, first of a kind new nuclear technology in Asia and beyond. Key issues to consider include:</p>
<p>First, management of regulatory risk &ndash; Failure to undertake thorough regulatory due diligence carries significant risk of delays and increased costs. Risk is magnified in new nuclear markets where the regulator is likely to be newly established, inexperienced in the application of a process in a practical context, possibly under budgetary constraints and/or suffering from political pressure.</p>
<p>Second, an integrated approach to contracting &ndash; In addition to due diligence on an often embryonic regulatory regime, deal flow inertia and logistical issues in emerging nuclear economies mean that a conservative approach to program development is prudent to avoid exposure to significant price and schedule overruns. Advanced investment in trusted and proven nuclear-specific project and construction/civil management resource is essential, as is the assembly of a viable, willing supply chain, with capacity.</p>
<p>Construction and commissioning of first of kind units domestically with associated final design development prior to their export is one way to mitigate this risk.</p>
<p>Third, liability for nuclear damage &ndash; to balance the need to encourage investment in nuclear power (with its potential for ruinous financial claims for nuclear damage in the event of a nuclear incident) with the availability of compensation for any victims of such an incident, most emerging nuclear economies are developing liability regimes that largely replicate the principles of international law in this area. These principles channel liability for such damage to the Operator and cap its liability. This is an important area of legal due diligence and feeds into contract negotiation so gaps in that liability regime (such as liability for damage incurred in neighboring countries and damage to the nuclear plant itself) can be bridged. However, the recent experience of BP in the USA after the Deepwater Horizon/Macondo oil spill illustrates the ever present political risk that any company associated with a serious nuclear incident will be unable to avoid a moral call for compensation.</p>
<p>Will Chinese, South Korean and Japanese vendors come to dominate the emerging Asian and global markets? China is on the verge of completing development of indigenous Generation III reactor technologies and is looking beyond that into Generation IV and perhaps to commercial nuclear fusion. With experienced prime contractors, intact local supply-chains and confident regulators they are as well-versed to break into new nuclear markets as the South Koreans and Japanese. But, notwithstanding their domestic success, these established Asian vendors (and indeed any global vendor) will need exercise increased caution when venturing out of their 'comfort zone' into new and inexperienced markets that are perhaps struggling to develop the intellectual and physical infrastructure necessary for a successful nuclear industry.</p>
<p>Therefore, the example of the developing nuclear economies in Asia shows the impact of such a technogenic factor as nuclear power on the development of economies, also indicating that technogenic factors are among those that influence not only the country, which considers these factors as a part of its economy policy, but also neighboring states that are bound to be effected by such a choice of initials of economy. Technology induces factors have a considerable ability to effect the entire system of international relations due to the fact that countries in possession of highly developed technologies are considered rival in the struggle for the upper hand in international relations, and, what is an even greater driving power, a possible threat to the world community if such a country will decide to use its technologies against its enemy.</p>
<p>But technogenic factors have also the power and tendency to affect not only the economy of the country applying to them and, simultaneously, the entire economy policy of such a state, but also political decisions of the said state and its foreign policy. This can be explained by the fact that technology development has an impact on the policies of the states, which then influence the political situation in the world by providing a basis for economic development and cooperation. On the other hand, possession of certain technologies can become the deciding factor in the question of the reaction of the world community to foreign policies of countries, be that economic, which may be illustrated by the ability and opportunities of Central Asian countries to transfer oil and gas to Europe or political that can be seen in the reaction of international actors to the declaration of North Korea of possession of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Thus, it is important to underline the interdependent link between economic, foreign and technology policies of different international actors, and understand that any false step taken in the development of technology policies might damage the relations between states.</p>
<p>On the other hand, technogenic factors that may bring destruction are used unguardedly, unwisely operated in the context of policy-making or combined with a natural disaster, can also uncover the true state of affairs, concerning international relations, not only of the neighboring states to the one that suffered a technogenic catastrophe, but also in the whole world. This can be explained by the fact that such circumstances affect the existing flow of international relations and the current economic and foreign policies of all the states. In addition to that such phenomena as technogenic catastrophes is able to create a possibility to gain a full view on the state of world economy and give an understanding not only of the level of integration in the framework of common markets, but also on a global scale. Such critical conditions as the aftermath of a technogenic catastrophe can be at some point considered as a kind of crash-test for economy and international relations, including political and social spheres. Although such a test if implicated with precision could be considered rather radical.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, the development of technology does not halt even for a minute, which means that the control that it has gained over foreign economic and political views of individual countries will only strengthen and these factors are now an essential part of the structure of international relations, being their ruling power to a smaller or greater extent depending on the individual aspects of the development and policy of each country in particular. As there is now no turning back on progress of civilizations and on the rapid and consuming development of technology, there is no possibility for technogenic factors to lessen their effect on international relations.</p>
<p>Technogenic factors are the dynamic power of the development and sometimes integration of foreign economics and policies. They will continue to influence the flow of international relations, balancing or destabilizing the current balance of power in the world arena in accordance with the dynamics of their own progress that differs from country to country, taking into account the level of its development, the economic, social and politic situation within the state, its geopolitical position.&nbsp;</p>
