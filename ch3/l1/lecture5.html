<center><p><strong>Lecture 5. The role of international organizations in the sphere of nuclear energy security provision</strong></p></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concerns regarding the threat of nuclear terrorism have, since the early 1970s, given momentum to international efforts to prevent terrorists acquiring fissile or other radioactive material. With a history that stretches back over four decades, the international nuclear security framework comprises a complex set of instruments and initiatives designed, in general terms, to prevent, deter and respond to non-state actor acquisition and use of nuclear material for malign purposes. The evolution of this framework has been sporadic with policies generally developing in response to emerging threats or perceived gaps in existing security structures. The initiatives that emerged after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, respectively, provide a testament to this effect. The complexity of the framework is primarily due to the sporadic nature of its evolution; this &lsquo;patchwork of agreements, resolutions, regulations, and guidelines was adopted in different forums, at different times, by different countries, and with different accountability measures&rsquo;. For this reason, the nuclear security policy landscape is often seen to be fragmented and lacking coherence.</p>
<p>The International Nuclear Regulators Association (INRA) was established in January 1997 and is an association that comprises the most senior officials of the nuclear regulatory authorities of the following countries: Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The main purpose of the association is to influence and enhance nuclear safety, from the regulatory prospective, among its members and worldwide.</p>
<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is the foremost international organization in the nuclear field headquartered in Vienna, Austria. The Agency was founded in 1957 as the &ldquo;Atoms for Peace&rdquo; organization in the United Nations. It now serves as an independent intergovernmental agency controlled by two main policymaking bodies &ndash; the 35-member Board of Governors and the General Conference of all Member States. Reports on IAEA activities are submitted to the UN Security Council and UN General Assembly. Three main areas of work underpin the IAEA&rsquo;s mission: Safety and Security, Science and Technology, and Safeguards and Verification. NRC staff work closely with the IAEA to develop new technology and policies that promote safe, secure, and peaceful uses of nuclear technology.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) is part of the Organization for Economic Corporation and Development (OECD) and currently has 28 member states, among which are many of the leading nuclear power countries of the world. NRC participates in the NEA through various committees, working groups, and meetings. NEA&rsquo;s support of detailed engineering and technological studies complements and expands NRC's research program in a cost-effective way.</p>
<p>The NEA aims at being a centre of excellence, capable of reacting to new challenges and circumstances by providing expert analyses and recommendations in a timely manner to member countries and other interested stakeholders.</p>
<p>Fulfillment of the goals and strategies set out in the Strategic Plan presupposes a stable and predictable level of financial resources. The Strategic Plan has been developed based on the hypothesis that resources over the next six years are sustainable. Particular attention will need to be paid to the management of human resources at the Agency, as the recruitment of well-qualified staff is essential to ensuring the Agency&rsquo;s ability to carry out the goals of the Strategic</p>
<p>Plan, and to ensure that its work is of the expected high quality.</p>
<p>To fulfill its mission, the NEA will pursue work within the following sector-specific activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nuclear safety and regulation;</li>
<li>Radioactive waste management;</li>
<li>Radiological protection and public health;</li>
<li>Nuclear science;</li>
<li>Development and use of nuclear energy;</li>
<li>Legal affairs;</li>
<li>Data Bank services;</li>
<li>Information and communication.</li>
</ol>
<p>These sectors of activity are central to the fulfillment of the NEA mission. They are elaborated individually in Chapter III. The introduction to each sector sets out the goal of NEA work in that area, and explains its importance as a core NEA activity. Strategies are then given to describe how the goal will be achieved.</p>
<p>Member countries have two interrelated objectives related to their nuclear facilities: maintaining and improving high standards of nuclear safety that reflect the current state of science and technology, and enhancing the quality and effectiveness of nuclear regulation. The NEA assists its member countries in maintaining and continuously evolving the scientific, technical and regulatory knowledge base required to ensure the safety of design, construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning of nuclear reactors and other civilian nuclear installations as well as the safety of nuclear activities. International nuclear co-operation greatly expands the base of knowledge and experience, thereby enhancing the national capacity for addressing safety concerns, and supporting efforts to maintain safety performance and regulation at the highest levels.</p>
