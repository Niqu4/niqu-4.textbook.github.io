<p><strong>Task 1 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>Today, one of the main problems of energy security provision is the need for nuclear power without nuclear proliferation. Some states with nuclear programs are considered a threat by the world community. This leads to international disputes and might in time become the reason for the states in questions to use their atoms for peace in the way that is feared.</p>
<ol>
<li>Give a critical analysis to the current level of nuclear energy security provision in the world.</li>
<li>Evaluate the efficiency of nuclear energy as a factor of international energy security provision, underlining the drawbacks of this selective type of energy as a destabilizing factor of international relations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Present an analytical note on the subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task 2 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>One of the threats to nuclear energy security provision is the vulnerability of nuclear plants.&nbsp; Nuclear plant security measures are designed to protect three primary areas of vulnerability: controls on the nuclear chain reaction, cooling systems that prevent hot nuclear fuel from melting even after the chain reaction has stopped, and storage facilities for highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. Most plants are designed and built to prevent dispersal of radioactivity, in the event of an accident, by surrounding the reactor in a steel-reinforced concrete containment structure. However, as the March 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan demonstrated, reactor containments cannot completely block radioactive releases under the most severe circumstances, such as when cooling systems are disabled for several hours or longer.</p>
<p>This leads the world community to understand the need for a more efficient way of providing nuclear energy security.</p>
<p>After the 2011 Fukushima catastrophe Germany is known to have made crash tests of all its nuclear plants, and eventually closed down most of them. Turkey, on the other hand, continued building another nuclear plant in cooperation with Russia.</p>
<ol>
<li>Give an expert evaluation of the changes in international relations that can follow a major disastrous flaw in nuclear energy provision. What are the main factors that are likely to influence a shift in international relations or cooperation? Give a presentation of your report.</li>

<p><strong>Task 3 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>The role of international organizations in regulating international relations in the sphere of alternative energy cannot be overlooked. Currently there are several organizations that specialize in the regulation of alternative energy as well as the shift of energy policies from oil and nuclear energy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Convey a comparative analysis of the work of IRENA and ITER in regard of the regulation of interstate relations in the field of alternative energy. Give an expert opinion on the question of which of these organizations is more effective due to the mechanisms of regulating international relations in the sphere.</li>
<li>Make a prognosis for the future of international cooperation (on a regional and global scale) in the framework of alternative energy provision.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task 4 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>Ethanol from Brazilian sugarcane, which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies as an "advanced" biofuel, has made inroads into U.S. markets. According to a Wall Street Journal report, roughly 90 percent of advanced biofuels counted toward U.S. quotas in 2012 were imported, mostly from Brazil. Indeed, U.S. biofuel policy toward Latin America will remain a topic of debate in Washington, particularly related to Brazilian imports, given the competitive threat they pose to U.S. corn ethanol producers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Can this tendency be considered a step towards a change in foreign affairs of the USA?</li>
<li>Write a report to highlight the changes in the external policy of a state of your choice connected with the growing need for alternative energy.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Task 5 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>Under new Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India hopes to become the &ldquo;renewable energy capital of the world.&rdquo; So far, India&rsquo;s ambitious targets for solar and wind deployment&mdash;second only to those of China&mdash;have attracted a flurry of foreign renewable energy company&rsquo;s eager for the business-friendly contracting policies promised by the government. Announcing aspiration goals to elicit a windfall in foreign financing could prove a clever strategy to bootstrap a thriving renewables industry&mdash;but beyond the fanfare, few details are forthcoming on how the government will actually improve the investment climate and why renewable energy will meet India&rsquo;s underlying energy needs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a prognosis for India&rsquo;s possibilities in obtaining new connections for future international cooperation in political and economic spheres.</li>
<li>Make a research and ascertain if other states are trying to use a similar strategy for economic and political cooperation as India.</li>
