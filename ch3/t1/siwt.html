<p><strong>Task 1 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>Nuclear energy has&nbsp; a&nbsp; key&nbsp; role&nbsp; to&nbsp; play&nbsp; in&nbsp; enhancing&nbsp; competitiveness&nbsp; and&nbsp; promoting sustainable development.&nbsp; The International Energy Agency (IEA) has indicated that in</p>
<p>nearly every region&nbsp; of the&nbsp; world, nuclear&nbsp; power&nbsp; plants&nbsp; have the&nbsp; cheapest&nbsp; electricity production costs. For many states, in particular energy-intensive industries, stable, predictable, and affordable energy prices are of paramount importance to boost economic growth and create jobs. Nuclear is the largest low-CO2 energy source, making it an important low-carbon contributor to climate change mitigation.</p>

<p><strong>Task 2 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>The March 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami that severely damaged the Fukushima Daiichi power plant has dampened what had been a renewed interest in nuclear power twenty-five years after the explosion at Chernobyl in northern Ukraine. That interest was sparked by rising energy demands in emerging markets and developing nations as well as the need to reduce use of fossil fuels in response to climate change, making nuclear more attractive though less competitive than other types of power. But the 2011 Fukushima incident has led to new scrutiny of plant safety regulations and emergency measures, and to questions about reactor design and how to deal with spent nuclear fuel. Still, while experts say Fukushima is likely to have some impact on nuclear power going forward, it is unlikely to be as disruptive for the industry as Chernobyl.</p>

<p><strong>Task 3 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new and safer reactor designs. However, a perfect safety cannot be guaranteed. The problem lies not only with technology or the human factor, but also in threat of renewed aggressive foreign policies that can lead to nuclear proliferation and the possibilities of terrorist organizations obtaining nuclear weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Task 4 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>Aside from the risk of a terrorist strike directly onto a nuclear power station, the nuclear industry transports thousands of tonnes of radioactive waste around the UK by road, rail and sea. Every week, communities up and down the country are put at risk from potential radioactive contamination as these trains trundle through our cities, towns and villages. There are no police or security personnel on board and there are no local plans in place to deal with an emergency. If a nuclear waste train was involved in a terrorist attack, tens of thousands of people could be exposed to cancer causing radiation and whole regions might have to be evacuated.</p>

<p><strong>Task 5 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>Nuclear energy is considered to be a strong incentive for nuclear weapons development. Nuclear weapons may create greater space for smaller powers to engage in coercive attacks and even limited military operations at lower levels of escalation. This phenomenon is often explored through examination of two cases: North Korea and Pakistan. For this reason, researchers often address key trends and current thinking on nuclear deterrence, review recent research on nuclear weapons and coercion.</p>
