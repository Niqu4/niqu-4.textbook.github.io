<p><strong>CHAPTER DESCRIPTION</strong></p></center>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Chapter &laquo;<em>Nuclear energy and the problems of alternative energy development</em>&raquo; is one of the elective disciplines within the course <em>&ldquo;Energy Factor in International Relations&rdquo;</em> for speciality 5B020200 &ndash; &ldquo;International Relations&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter objective</strong> &ndash; to create a common understanding of the problems of energy security provision in international relations; identify basic reasons for possible confrontations and international tension points in the field of nuclear energy security; identify methods for a comparative analysis in this area; create a knowledge of possible threats of nuclear energy to international relations and methods of counteractions; understanding of international threats connected with nuclear energy development; identifying reasons for international confrontations and disputes in the course of transition to alternative energy sources. Students develop a comprehensive picture of nuclear and alternative energy security policy and obtain an understanding of the possible methods of energy security provision.</p>

<li>The knowledge of the differences between political and economic diversification dimensions of energy security provision and the role of nuclear power and alternative resources.</li>
<li>The knowledge of energy problems of the world community, energy based relations on a global and regional scale, common mechanisms of foreign policies of different states in the nuclear energy sector.</li>
<li>The knowledge of perspectives of future development of alternative energy as a part of energy security provision strategies.</li>
<li>Skills of written comparative analysis.</li>
<li>Skills to determine the advisability of the research topic and comparative analysis regarding nuclear and alternative energy security.</li>

<p><strong>CC</strong> (Current control) is the systematic control of the students&rsquo; academic achievements on each theme and unit conducted by the leader teachers.</p>
<p><strong>CR</strong> (Current rating) is the periodical control of the students&rsquo; academic achievements after each module held in accordance with the academic calendar.</p>
<p>Modular control in divided into the first and second rating control, which are held on the seventh and fourteenth week of the semester. Learners who could not get average rating on the discipline less than 50%, are not admitted to the exam, and have to RETAKE the course.</p>
<p>The final rating is formed from marks of Current control, 2 current (bound) rating and final exam. Current (bound) rating I &ndash; 30%, Current (bound) rating II - 30% and exam &ndash; 40%.</p>
<p><strong>Two current (bound) ratings (CR1, CR2) include control on 3 directions, which is reflected in the following tasks:</strong></p>
<p>1 task - theoretical</p>
<p>1 task &ndash; standard professional task</p>
<p>1 task &ndash; individual-creative task or presentation of the project</p>

<p>Final rating of the discipline is defined as a sum of maximum indexes of progress on current ratings (60%) и intermediate attestation (exam) &ndash; 40% and comprises 100%.</p>
<p><strong>Final rating is calculated according to the formula:</strong></p>
<p>(R1+ R2)</p>
<p>FR= [---------------] х 0,6 + Ех 0,4</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2</p>

<p>R1 - numerical equivalent of the first rating;</p>
<p>R2 - numerical equivalent of the second rating;</p>
<p>Е - numerical equivalent of the first rating at the exam.</p>
<p>Average score of progress</p>

<p><strong>The methodical recommendations for studying the discipline &ldquo;Nuclear energy and the problems of alternative energy development&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of these methodological guidelines is to present the basic requirements of Research Paper (hereinafter &ndash; RP) for students studying the discipline &ldquo;Nuclear energy and the problems of alternative energy development&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Students have to deliver written work of different complexity:</p>
<p><strong>Essay.</strong> This is the smallest scale, well-structured, consistent, easy-to-read written work, where the student can clearly express his/her approach, analysis and solutions to different claims and problems presented in scientific literature.</p>
<p><strong>Descriptive or synoptic paper.</strong> This pattern of work is greater in volume than the essay, it presents scientifically valid opinions and their critical evaluation in a consistent way and the assessment of this type of written work usually makes up a solid part of accumulative mark.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Research paper</strong>. It is written in frequent consultation with supervisors. Its goal is to deepen the knowledge acquired during lectures and practical seminars, to develop students&rsquo; critical thinking skills, their ability to raise issues competently and provide solutions under the chosen topic. The empirical nature of the research paper requires to collect data independently, present and analyze them properly and to use the results of the analysis in other decision making processes - not only discussing about new theories or models, but complementing them as well.</p>
<p><strong>Report</strong> is an extended public written account on a certain topic in a particular study course.</p>
<p><strong>Course paper</strong> is aimed to demonstrate the student&rsquo;s abilities and research skills as well as his/her theoretical knowledge, according to the level of the course, in identifying and solving problems. The course paper will comply with the following requirements:</p>
<p>-it will be an independent research on a topical issue;</p>
<p>-it will contain accurate, clear and logical presentation of the progress of the research and its results, as well as conclusions and suggestions the author has arrived to;</p>
<p>-it will demonstrate the students grasp of using and evaluating specialized literature and other sources, gathering and processing information, as well as applying research methods and computer technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Qualification paper, bachelor&rsquo;s thesis and diploma paper</strong> are aimed to systematize, broaden and consolidate both the theoretical knowledge and the practical skills. The Paper will necessarily contain theoretical and practical parts. In the theoretical part the student will show his/her ability to research and solve a particular theoretical problem. The theoretical part will be in line with the practical part.</p>
