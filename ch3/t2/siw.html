<p><strong>Task 6 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>Over the past decade, governments around the world threw money at renewable power. Private investors followed, hoping to cash in on what looked like an imminent epic shift in the way the world produced electricity. It all seemed intoxicating and revolutionary: a way to boost jobs, temper fossil-fuel prices, and curb global warming, while minting new fortunes in the process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Give an expert evaluation to the reasons of the lack of actual efficiency of alternative energy in the last decade.</li>
<li>Prepare a presentation with a critical analysis of realistic future development of alternative energy security provision, highlighting major alternative energy resources.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Task 7 - hr</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Our changing global climate, access to clean energy and water, food security, and population growth are all among the web of complex interdependent challenges facing the world. The first, global climate change is perhaps the most pressing threat to humanity and the future of the planet. Recent reports such as the Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) documents that climate change is real, and that the related impacts are already beginning to affect different parts of the world. Everyone can relate to the apparent physical and financial impacts of this anthropogenic phenomenon. These impacts will be exacerbated in the coming the decades, unless aggressive measures are taken to mitigate negative consequences and adapt our responses to the new environment.</p>
<p>One response to climate change is for the world to transition to a low-carbon energy future through increased use of renewable energy sources. Across the world, governments are scaling up their efforts to spur more investments in wind, solar, and other forms of low-carbon energy. As a result, electricity generated from wind and solar energy is growing rapidly worldwide. There is strong correlation between successful integration of renewable energy and the employment of policies and regulatory mechanisms that catalyze private sector investment. Businesses, therefore, also need to adapt radically practical strategies. However, as the penetration of renewables increases, one quandary that continues to receive much attention focuses on how to gracefully integrate these nonconventional, variable forms of energy into existing grids and eventually emerging grids, as well as into electricity markets.</p>
<ol>
<li>Analyze the current level of international cooperation and integration (choose a region or monitor developments on a global scale) in the field of alternative energy.</li>
<li>Make a prognosis for the future of global integration on the basis of alternative energy promotion and recommend possible changes of contemporary policies in order to improve alternative energy security provision.</li>

<p><strong>Task 8 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>The expansion of the renewable energy industry is of strategic national importance for China in the context of upgrading its existing industrial infrastructure and is recognized as an important sector for the creation of future value-added jobs. Meeting the demand of surging export markets for renewable energy technologies&mdash;mainly solar PV&mdash;was a major driver for the Chinese government. Diversification of the energy supply and security of supply both play an important role. Air pollution, in particular across Eastern China, has recently emerged as an important driver for new renewable energy expansion plans in that region. An equally important driver is the need to foster decentralized/distributed power generation capacities to avoid the enormous financial expenditures associated with relying entirely on long-distance transmission lines, which otherwise would have to transmit power generated in West China to East China.</p>
<ol>
<li>Compare the main driving reasons for the development of alternative energy in China with the situation in Central Asian states.</li>
<li>Build a scenario of the development of interstate cooperation and integration in Central Asia in the sphere of alternative energy provision. Suggest possible methods of improvement.</li>

<p><strong>Task 9 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>The United Arab Emirates on Saturday signed an agreement with India for cooperation in renewable energy, especially in the areas of solar and wind power, according to official statement reported by The Economic Times. The understanding includes developing a joint working group in order to coordinate research on subject of mutual interest and exchange of scientific data. The deal was signed in Abu Dhabi, where India&rsquo;s Minister of new and renewable energy was on an official visit to, and where the city&rsquo;s Sustainability Week was held.</p>
<p>During the event Sultan Al Jaber, UEA Minister of state and CEO of the energy company Masdar, announced the country&rsquo;s plan to deploy renewable energy projects in five Pacific island countries, including Fiji, Kiribati, Samoa, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. The projects will be financed from the $50 million UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund, launched in March 2013, with grant financing from Abu Dhabi Fund for Development. The solar and wind projects will be implemented by Masdar and are planned to be completed in late 2014.</p>
<p>The Abu Dhabi energy company operates several renewable energy projects worldwide. According to Gulf Business, among which there are a 15MW solar PV power plant in Mauritania, a 6MW wind farm in Seychelles, a 600-residences off-grid solar PV systems in Afghanistan, a 500KW solar PV power plant in Tonga.</p>
<ol>
<li>Conduct a review of the possible impact of such a step of the United Arab Emirates on the world community in general and international relations of different states with the UEA.</li>
<li>Complete an essay, giving an expert opinion on the possibilities of similar agreements between states of Central Asia.</li>
