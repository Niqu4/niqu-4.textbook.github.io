<p><strong>Task 6 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>In essence, however, renewable energy technologies face the same situation confronting any new technology that attempts to dislodge an entrenched technology. For many years, industrialized countries have been 'locked into' a suite of fossil fuel and nuclear- based technologies, and many secondary systems and networks have been designed and constructed accordingly. Just as electric-drive vehicles face an uphill battle to dislodge gasoline-fueled, internal combustion engine vehicles, so, too, do solar, wind, and biomass technologies face obstacles to replace modern coal, oil, and natural gas power plants.</p>

<p><strong>Task 7 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>The developed economies in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) like Japan, United States, Australia, New Zealand, Korea and Canada, are promoting the development of renewable energy policy from the viewpoint of preventing a global warming policy. On the other hand, many of the developing economies in APEC develop renewable energy to reduce the import of oil due to soaring oil prices. Renewable energy as a domestic energy policy can replace the import of oil in order to reduce the financial pressure. In other words, the promotion of renewable energy is from the viewpoint of security of energy supply.</p>

<p><strong>Task 8 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>Each country faces different barriers to mainstreaming renewable energy. Developing nations&rsquo; priority is increasing energy access to all people, while encouraging economic development and sustainable lifestyles. Economies in transition must encourage competition in their energy markets in order to draw investment. Industrialized countries have established oil dependencies maintained by subsidies, corporate power and the public's reluctance to change. However, encouraging competitive energy markets in all nations around the world will accelerate the use of renewables.</p>

<p><strong>Task 9 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, governments have intervened in the energy sector because they considered access to energy to be a public good. When a good or service innately benefits society, but the benefit is not captured in the market price, this product tends to be underproduced. Energy is a public good because it empowers communities and benefits one's standard of living. Consequently, governments have justified providing subsidies and widening access through public ownership and regulation.</p>
<p>Now the world faces risks from global climate change and local ecosystem destruction due to the carbon dioxide emissions and other pollutants from fossil fuel combustion. These are one of the factors that highlight the need for international cooperation and possible integration in the field of alternative energy.</p>

<p><strong>Task 10 &ndash; 3hr</strong></p>
<p>Germany is often cited as a role model for the planned transformation by Kazakh politicians and the media. &ldquo;Following the leading German experience, the President has decided to make the environment ministry responsible for policy making on renewable energy and the ministry of industry and new technology its implementation,&rdquo; Kazakh environment minister Nurlan Kapparov told journalists in February 2013. By developing renewables, Kapparov hopes to create new jobs in the country, citing impressive figures from the green jobs market in Germany.</p>
