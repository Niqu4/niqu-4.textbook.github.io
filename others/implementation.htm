<p>Having reviewed the materials prepared by Innovative Educational Center at Kazakh Ablai Khan University of International Relations and World Languages in English for the specialty: 5B020200 &ndash; &ldquo;International relations&rdquo; and considered the basic course includes the following areas: &nbsp;&ldquo;Hydro energy contradictions in Central Asia&rdquo;, &ldquo;Oil and gas factors in energy security provision&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nuclear energy and the problems of alternative energy development&rdquo; concluded:</p>
<p>1. Modern development of international relations takes place, on the one hand, in the course of globalization processes in the energy sector, and on the other - intensification of the struggle for non-renewable energy resources. In the reality of today's world, energy security becomes relevant, since it is one of the most important components of national security of any actor in international relations. At this stage, it increased attention to energy security, which is placed at the forefront of the foreign policy of most countries. Energy security policy defines interstate relations until the outbreak of war issues, influencing also on the development of internal policies. Thus, the energy security of close ties with the other components of national security, as well as other areas of socio-political life of the state give rise to the need for experts in the field.</p>
<p>2. Courses are developed on a high quality level. They cover the necessary basic knowledge of energy security and sustainable development. The implemented technologies of teaching in the classroom to help develop the necessary analytical competence in students so that they can equally compete with foreign experts. The sequence of thematic tasks, the logical development of courses, themes of independent work of students meet the most popular needs.</p>
<p>In summary, I recommend courses: &ldquo;Hydro energy contradictions in Central Asia&rdquo;, &ldquo;Oil and gas factors in energy security provision&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nuclear energy and the problems of alternative energy development&rdquo; to include in the curriculum of students of 3<sup>rd</sup> year specialty: 5B020200 &ndash; &ldquo;International Relations&rdquo; at Kazakh Ablai Khan University of International Relations and World Languages.</p>
