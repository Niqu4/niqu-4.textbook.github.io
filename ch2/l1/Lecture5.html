<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Iraq,
Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan, Ukraine, the East and South China Seas:
wherever you look, the world is aflame with new or intensifying
conflicts. At first glance, these upheavals appear to be independent
events, driven by their own unique and idiosyncratic circumstances. 
But look more closely and they share several key characteristics —
notably, a witch’s brew of ethnic, religious, and national
antagonisms that have been stirred to the boiling point by a fixation
on energy.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
each of these conflicts, the fighting is driven in large part by the
eruption of long-standing historic antagonisms among neighboring
(often intermingled) tribes, sects, and peoples.  In Iraq and Syria,
it is a clash among Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds, Turkmen, and others; in
Nigeria, among Muslims, Christians, and assorted tribal groupings; in
South Sudan, between the Dinka and Nuer; in Ukraine, between
Ukrainian loyalists and Russian-speakers aligned with Moscow; in the
East and South China Sea, among the Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese,
Filipinos, and others.  It would be easy to attribute all this to
age-old hatreds, as suggested by many analysts; but while such
hostilities do help drive these conflicts, they are fueled by a most
modern impulse as well: the desire to control valuable oil and
natural gas assets.  Make no mistake about it; these are
twenty-first-century energy wars.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">It
should surprise no one that energy plays such a significant role in
these conflicts.  Oil and gas are, after all, the world’s most
important and valuable commodities and constitute a major source of
income for the governments and corporations that control their
production and distribution.  Indeed, the governments of Iraq,
Nigeria, Russia, South Sudan, and Syria derive the great bulk of
their revenues from oil sales, while the major energy firms (many
state-owned) exercise immense power in these and the other countries
involved. Whoever controls these states, or the oil- and
gas-producing areas within them, also controls the collection and
allocation of crucial revenues. Despite the patina of historical
enmities, many of these conflicts, then, are really struggles for
control over the principal source of national income.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Moreover,
we live in an energy-centric world where control over oil and gas
resources (and their means of delivery) translates into geopolitical
clout for some and economic vulnerability for others. Because so many
countries are dependent on energy imports, nations with surpluses to
export — including Iraq, Nigeria, Russia, and South Sudan — often
exercise disproportionate influence on the world stage. What happens
in these countries sometimes matters as much to the rest of us as to
the people living in them, and so the risk of external involvement in
their conflicts — whether in the form of direct intervention, arms
transfers, the sending in of military advisers, or economic
assistance — is greater than almost anywhere else.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
struggle over energy resources has been a conspicuous factor in many
recent conflicts, including the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988, the Gulf
War of 1990-1991, and the Sudanese Civil War of 1983-2005. On first
glance, the fossil-fuel factor in the most recent outbreaks of
tension and fighting may seem less evident. But look more closely and
you’ll see that each of these conflicts is, at heart, an energy
war.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the Sunni extremist group
that controls large chunks of western Syria and northern Iraq, is
well-armed militia intent on creating an Islamic caliphate in the
areas it controls. In some respects, it is a fanatical, sectarian
religious organization, seeking to reproduce the pure, uncorrupted
piety of the early Islamic era. At the same time, it is engaged in a
conventional nation-building project, seeking to create a fully
functioning state with all its attributes.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">As
the United States learned to its dismay in Iraq and Afghanistan,
nation-building is expensive: institutions must be created and
financed, armies recruited and paid, weapons and fuel procured, and
infrastructure maintained. Without oil (or some other lucrative
source of income), ISIS could never hope to accomplish its ambitious
goals. However, as it now occupies key oil-producing areas of Syria
and oil-refining facilities in Iraq, it is in a unique position to do
so. Oil, then, is absolutely essential to the organization’s grand
strategy.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Syria
was never a major oil producer, but its prewar production of some
400,000 barrels per day did provide the regime of Bashar al-Assad
with a major source of income. Now, most of the country’s oil
fields are under the control of rebel groups, including ISIS, the
al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, and local Kurdish militias. Although
production from the fields has dropped significantly, enough is being
extracted and sold through various clandestine channels to provide
the rebels with income and operating funds. “Syria is an oil
country and has resources, but in the past they were all stolen by
the regime,” said Abu Nizar, an anti-government activist. “Now
they are being stolen by those who are profiting from the
revolution.”</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">At
first, many rebel groups were involved in these extractive
activities, but since January, when it assumed control of Raqqa, the
capital of the province of that name, ISIS has been the dominant
player in the oil fields. In addition, it has seized fields in
neighboring Deir al-Zour Province along the Iraq border. Indeed, many
of the U.S.-supplied weapons it acquired from the fleeing Iraqi army
after its recent drive into Mosul and other northern Iraqi cities
have been moved into Deir al-Zour to help in the organization’s
campaign to take full control of the region.  In Iraq, ISIS is
fighting to gain control over Iraq’s largest refinery at Baiji in
the central part of the country.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">It
appears that ISIS sells oil from the fields it controls to shadowy
middlemen who in turn arrange for its transport — mostly by tanker
trucks — to buyers in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey.  These sales are
said to provide the organization with the funds needed to pay its
troops and acquire its vast stockpiles of arms and ammunition. Many
observers also claim that ISIS is selling oil to the Assad regime in
return for immunity from government air strikes of the sort being
launched against other rebel groups. “Many locals in Raqqa accuse
ISIS of collaborating with the Syrian regime, a Kurdish journalist,
Sirwan Kajjo, reported in early June. “Locals say that while other
rebel groups in Raqqa have been under attack by regime air strikes on
a regular basis, ISIS headquarters have not once been attacked”.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">However,
the present fighting in northern Iraq plays out, it is obvious that
there, too, oil is a central factor. ISIS seeks both to deny
petroleum supplies and oil revenue to the Baghdad government and to
bolster its own coffers, enhancing its capacity for nation-building
and further military advances. At the same time, the Kurds and
various Sunni tribes — some allied with ISIS — want control over
oil fields located in the areas under their control and a greater
share of the nation’s oil wealth.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
Nigeria, the insurgent group Boko Haram is fighting to overthrow the
existing political system and establish a puritanical, Muslim-ruled
state. Although most Nigerians decry the group’s violent methods
(including the kidnapping of hundreds of teenage girls from a
state-run school), it has drawn strength from disgust in the
poverty-stricken northern part of the country with the
corruption-riddled central government in distant Abuja, the capital.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Nigeria
is the largest oil producer in Africa, pumping out some 2.5 million
barrels per day.  With oil selling at around $100 per barrel, this
represents a potentially staggering source of wealth for the nation,
even after the private companies involved in the day-to-day
extractive operations take their share. Were these revenues —
estimated in the tens of billions of dollars per year — used to
spur development and improve the lot of the population, Nigeria could
be a great beacon of hope for Africa. Instead, much of the money
disappears into the pockets (and foreign bank accounts) of Nigeria’s
well-connected elites.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
February, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Lamido Sanusi
told a parliamentary investigating committee that the state-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had failed to transfer
some $20 billion in proceeds from oil sales to the national treasury,
as required by law.  It had all evidently been diverted to private
accounts. “A substantial amount of money has gone,” he told the
New York Times. “I wasn’t just talking about numbers. I showed it
was a scam”.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">For
many Nigerians — a majority of whom subsist on less than $2 per day
— the corruption in Abuja, when combined with the wanton brutality
of the government’s security forces, is a source of abiding anger
and resentment, generating recruits for insurgent groups like Boko
Haram and winning them begrudging admiration. “They know well the
frustration that would drive someone to take up arms against the
state,” said National Geographic reporter James Verini of people he
interviewed in battle-scarred areas of northern Nigeria. At this
stage, the government has displayed zero capacity to overcome the
insurgency, while its ineptitude and heavy-handed military tactics
have only further alienated ordinary Nigerians.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
conflict in South Sudan has different roots, but shares a common link
to energy.  Indeed, the very formation of South Sudan is a product of
oil politics.  A civil war in Sudan that lasted from 1955 to 1972
only ended when the Muslim-dominated government in the north agreed
to grant more autonomy to the peoples of the southern part of the
country, largely practitioners of traditional African religions or
Christianity. However, when oil was discovered in the south, the
rulers of northern Sudan repudiated many of their earlier promises
and sought to gain control over the oil fields, sparking a second
civil war, which lasted from 1983 to 2005. An estimated two million
people lost their lives in this round of fighting.  In the end, the
south was granted full autonomy and the right to vote on secession.
Following a January 2011 referendum in which 98.8% of southerners
voted to secede, the country became independent on that July 9th.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
new state had barely been established, however, when conflict with
the north over its oil resumed. While South Sudan has a plethora of
oil, the only pipeline allowing the country to export its energy
stretches across North Sudan to the Red Sea. This ensured that the
south would be dependent on the north for the major source of
government revenues. Furious at the loss of the fields, the
northerners charged excessively high rates for transporting the oil,
precipitating a cutoff in oil deliveries by the south and sporadic
violence along the two countries’ still-disputed border. Finally,
in August 2012, the two sides agreed to a formula for sharing the
wealth and the flow of oil resumed. Fighting has, however, continued
in certain border areas controlled by the north but populated by
groups linked to the south.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">With
the flow of oil income assured, the leader of South Sudan, President
Salva Kiir, sought to consolidate his control over the country and
all those oil revenues. Claiming an imminent coup attempt by his
rivals, led by Vice President Riek Machar, he disbanded his
multiethnic government on July 24, 2013, and began arresting allies
of Machar. The resulting power struggle quickly turned into an ethnic
civil war, with the kin of President Kiir, a Dinka, battling members
of the Nuer group, of which Machar is a member. Despite several
attempts to negotiate a cease-fire, fighting has been under way since
December, with thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands
forced to flee their homes.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">As
in Syria and Iraq, much of the fighting in South Sudan has centered
on the vital oil fields, with both sides determined to control them
and collect the revenues they generate.  As of March, while still
under government control, the Paloch field in Upper Nile State was
producing some 150,000 barrels a day, worth about $15 million to the
government and participating oil companies. The rebel forces, led by
former Vice President Machar, are trying to seize those fields to
deny this revenue to the government. “The presence of forces loyal
to Salva Kiir in Paloch, to buy more arms to kill our people… is
not acceptable to us,” Machar said in April.  “We want to take
control of the oil field. It’s our oil.” As of now, the field
remains in government hands, with rebel forces reportedly making
gains in the vicinity.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
