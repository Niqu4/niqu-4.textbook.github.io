is no doubt regarding the importance of energy security for all
countries in the world – whether developed, developing,
energy-producing or consuming countries – due to the importance of

today is the source of life for all countries of the world and
therefore all countries in the world started to build a system for
energy security commensurate with their needs and their energy
situation. So the concept of energy security varies from state to
state - depending on needs and conditions.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">States
can be classified according to their energy needs to include:
producing and exporting countries of energy resources. Importing
countries of energy resources try to meet their energy needs from
abroad at acceptable affordable stable prices to ensure economic
growth. Producing –importing countries, such as the United States,
do have some energy deposits, but not enough to their economic needs
and thus they are also dependent on the outside to meet their growing
needs. Therefore, there are different dimensions of energy security
from state to state, depending on the circumstances and situation of
each country. According to Committees of U.S Congress, the United
States consumes about 18.8 million barrels of oil per day, while it
produces just about 6 million barrels a day. So, the country needs to
import about 13 million barrels a day from abroad. Therefore, energy
security for the US refers to secure supply of energy fuels, as well
as imports, technologies that promote self-sufficiency, protection
against disruptions including hedging against price volatility,
encouraging diversity of technologies and source, reduced threats to
and or from other states, well-functioning markets and improved
environmental sustainability. The most extended meaning of energy
security refers to the availability of sufficient energy supplies at
affordable prices, thus focusing on the supply side of the energy
domain. The first definitions of energy security were given by the
IEA in 1985. The Agency referred to energy security in a rather
simplistic manner as: an “adequate supply of energy at a reasonable
cost”. The IEA has restated the definition through the years to
characterize energy security as adequate, affordable and reliable
supply of energy. But IEA added later environmental and
sustainability issues to the definition of energy security.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre (APERC, 2007), emphasizes the
“four approaches” of: Availability, Accessibility, Affordability
and Acceptability: when dealing with energy security. APERC defines
energy security as “the ability of an economy to guarantee the
availability of the supply of energy resources in a sustainable and
timely manner with the energy price being at a level that will not
adversely affect the economic performance of the economy”.
According to that view, security of energy supply is affected by
factors such as the (physical) availability and the (geopolitical)
accessibility of energy sources, the (price and cost of
infrastructures) affordability of energy as well as the
(environmental) acceptability. Bohi and Toman (1996) define energy
insecurity as the loss of welfare resulting from a change in the
price or physical availability of energy. And therefore Bohi and
Toman tied energy security and access to stable, durable and
affordable energy, and energy insecurity means higher prices largely
which prevent a country from obtaining it properly, which can affect
economic growth. Yergin (2006) defines energy security in terms of
the resilience of an energy system to respond to shocks and
facilitate recovery after disruption. In his definition, Yergin
depends on a package of measures, political, economic means to ensure
the continued supply of energy and to face any future disruption.
Watson and Scott (2008) defined energy security in terms of the
following categories of threats or risks to energy security:</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

citizens and businesses have access to sufficient energy resources at
reasonable prices for the foreseeable future, free from serious risk
of major disruption of service. He added that the best solution of

second element refers to the price that should be reasonable. Energy

(Bohi and Toman 1996). A third element alludes to the notion of
public service Hogan 2007 defined energy security as the adequate and
reliable supply of energy at reasonable prices, in order to sustain
economic growth. This definition links energy use and economic growth
and recognizes the potential for sharp increases in energy prices to
impose costs on the economy and to potentially affect economic
growth. It also includes an idea about the physical availability of
primary energy resources (in particular coal, oil and gas), combined
with the affordability of that energy source.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

countries promote the reduction in energy imports (through subsidies

the export of energy resources to support economic growth and if its

evolving from their historic dependence on fossil fuels in response
to the climate change threat, market failure of the supply chain, and
increasing reliance on global energy markets, thereby necessitating
the wiser use of energy in all sectors. A rapid transition toward new
energy supply systems with reduced carbon intensity needs to be
managed to minimize economic, social and technological risks and to
co-opt those stakeholders who retain strong interests in maintaining
the status quo. The electricity, building and industry sectors are
beginning to become more proactive and help governments make the
