oil and natural gas industry shares a keen interest in the policy

businesses running continues to increase, so does our advancement in
technology, allowing us to provide safe, reliable, and affordable

American people want an energy policy to develop our domestic oil and

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">America
now occupies a position of energy leadership that was unthinkable a
short time ago. Gone are the days of uncertainty and concern over
having the supply of energy we need, when we need it. Today, the
United States is the world’s top producer of natural gas, the
world’s leading refiner of petroleum products, and very soon could
be the leading producer of oil. These developments are strengthening
America’s energy and economic security and benefiting tens of
millions of individuals, from current and future workers in the
industry to those who have pension plans or 401(k) retirement
accounts that invest in oil and natural gas companies, and for every
American every day in maintaining a high quality of life.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">But
this is only part of America’s larger energy story. The United
States is in the midst of a new era in domestic energy abundance
characterized by rising use of renewable energy and increased oil and
natural gas production that is strengthening our economic outlook and
enabling America to emerge as a global energy superpower. It is a
remarkable transformation that has been made possible because America
is uniquely rich in energy resources, a talented workforce and
cutting edge energy technologies. Nuclear energy, fossil fuels and
renewable energy sources alike are vital components of the larger
energy portfolio working to keep our economy moving. And with both
world and U.S. energy demand expected to increase in the future, the
continued availability of the full range of America’s energy
resources will grow in importance. Today, different sectors of the
economy rely on certain forms of energy. Transportation is largely
fueled by oil, while electricity generation is powered by coal,
nuclear, natural gas and renewables. Looking ahead a quarter century
from now, this is not expected to change, which means each energy
source — from oil and natural gas to solar and wind energy; from
coal and nuclear to hydropower, geothermal and biomass — will
remain essential to successfully meet America’s future energy
needs.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Oil
has been the foundation of the expansion and modernization of
America’s economy for more than a century. While the United States
in recent history largely looked to foreign nations to satisfy its
demand for oil, new cutting-edge technologies now enable America to
capitalize on abundant domestic petroleum resources to increasingly
meet its own current and future energy needs.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
results are striking. Since 2008, America’s crude oil production
has surged by 70 percent, rising from an average of 5 million barrels
per day in 2008 to 8.6 million barrels per day in August 2014. At its
current production rate, the United States is anticipated to surpass
both Saudi Arabia and Russia, historically two top energy producers,
to become the world’s largest producer of oil this year.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Not
surprisingly, America’s new era in oil production has reverberated
throughout the economy. The oil and natural gas industry contributed
$1.2 trillion to U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2011, and at a
time when other industries have been slow to add jobs in the wake of
the recent recession, the oil industry supports 9.8 million jobs
across the nation, up 600,000 from just two years earlier.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Looking
to tomorrow, petroleum will continue to be fundamental to America’s
economic growth and prosperity. Oil represents the lifeblood of the
U.S. economy, providing for more than one-third of our current energy
needs, and this is not expected to change significantly over the next
quarter century.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">A
strong domestic refining industry is essential to America’s energy
and economic security. Cleaner-burning gasoline and diesel, as well
as biofuels, jet fuel and heating oil, fuel our homes and businesses
and enable the movement of goods and people that is essential to a
growing economy. Thanks to more efficient operations, U.S. refiners
have increased capacity by roughly 16 percent over the past two
decades and today are refining near record amounts of crude oil.
America became a net exporter of petroleum products in 2011,
demonstrating the economic advantages of a robust domestic refining
base that has access to overseas markets while meeting U.S. demand.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">We
must also support vital infrastructure projects, such as the Keystone
XL pipeline. This much-needed addition to America’s energy
infrastructure would have the capacity to transport up to 830,000
barrels of oil a day. Adding to the already operational southern leg,
Keystone would bring both Canadian and U.S. oil to refineries for
processing. Additionally, about 10 percent of the pipeline’s
capacity could also be used to bring oil produced in remote areas of
North Dakota and Montana to market. Approving Keystone will enable
the U.S. to make significant strides toward meeting all of its liquid
fuel needs from North American oil by 2024, and create and enhance
efficiencies between the production and refining sectors.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Also,
federal lands and offshore resources must be opened for development.
Developing oil and natural gas resources that have been kept
off-limits by Congress could result in more than $1.85 trillion in
government revenue over the life of the resource. Recent studies by
Quest Offshore estimated that opening up offshore regions in the
Atlantic, Pacific and the eastern Gulf of Mexico for development
could result in 839,000 new jobs and generate $38 billion per year
for state and federal governments by 2035.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Finally,
with the United States on the verge of becoming the world’s largest
oil producer, eliminating trade restrictions dating back to the 1970s
that prohibit crude oil exports would strengthen America’s position
as an energy resource to the world and its economic outlook. A recent
study concluded that allowing crude oil exports could save consumers
as much as $5.8 billion a year in lower fuel costs and add up to
300,000 jobs. In fact, the 2014 U.S. trade deficit through August,
all else equal, was nearly 18 percent lower due to petroleum product
exports, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
