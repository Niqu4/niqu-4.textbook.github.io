is source of economic growth and social progress for all countries of
the world exporting countries and importing countries, it is source
of life for all. Therefore, all countries must build and develop an
energy security system to protect these important sources. Energy has
an impact on the economy and, in turn, is affected by it. Energy
consumption is both a necessary condition for growth and a
consequence of it, the economic growth depends heavily on the energy
resources which available in limited geographical areas of the world
such, as the Middle East, which owns more than half the world's
reserves of oil and natural gas. It is the main source of energy
resources but, at the same time, a source of conflict and instability
in the world, which can reflect negatively on the economic growth of
the importing countries.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

the other side, the rapid economic growth of many countries of the
world, and the emergence of giant economics, such as India and China,
may create new problems in the field of energy such as straining the

necessary to create a system of energy security for finding
alternative sources of energy such as renewable energy to reduce the
pressure on the energy resources and to promote the use of clean
energy that would help protect on the environment.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">With
increasing global energy consumption and the intensification of
competition and conflict over energy, the need to build energy
security system has become a pressing issue in order to deal with
reducing imports, increasing consumption and getting away from
conflict resulting from competition for energy resources. Building of
a global energy system could provide mechanisms for international
cooperation and coordination, in order to strengthen the collective
energy security and to develop alternative solutions to reliance on
renewable resources, instead of fossil fuels.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
concept of energy security appeared in the early 1970s, after the oil
crisis resulting from the Arab- Israeli war that led to the oil Arab
embargo against countries that’s supported Israel at that stage.
The Arab oil embargo had disastrous results in Europe and America and
had a negative impact on the global economy which entered into a real
recession, especially in developed countries. This is what prompted
those countries to advocate the establishment of the International
Energy Agency to deal with oil crises, and ensure access to imports
constant of oil. Therefore, the first energy security concept came
through the International Energy Agency in 1974. The international
energy agency defines energy security primarily in term of stable
supplies of oil and natural gas. However, this definition does not
address the multidimensional nature of energy security for the
developing world. ESMAP has redefined energy security to address the
micro and macro level needs of developing countries as follows: a
country ‘s ability to optimize its energy resources portfolio and
supply of energy services for the desired level of services that will
sustain economic growth and poverty reduction. Energy security is
defined traditionally as following terms:</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
traditional elements of energy security include: supply sources,
demand centers, geopolitics and market structures. In the energy
crisis 1970s, the primary focus for the western industrial counties
was on oil supply source and geopolitics. These two elements were the
underlying causes of energy security concerns and the demand center,
market structures and new institutions created the solutions to the
two energy crises that occurred.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
definition of energy security has changed over time since 1973 and so
far, the definition of energy security is no longer linked to the
risk of supplies cut from the Middle East, as happened in 1973. Since
then, a lot of new factors have been added to the concept of energy.
These factors include political conflicts, unexpected natural
disasters, concern on terrorism, and environmental challenges.
Therefore, there are three fundamental elements of energy security
that need to be taken into account to evolve future energy security
policy as also to ensure long term sustainability. These are:</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">By
establishing the Energy Dialogue, the parties put forward five major
topics of common interest. Those topics included ensuring the
security of energy supplies of the European continent, the
development of the potential of the Russian economy, in particular
Russia’s energy resources, the opportunities of the Pan-European
market, the challenge of climate change and the conditions framing
the use of nuclear energy. It is thus evident, that the major part of
the ECT elements was embodied in the programme of the Energy
Dialogue. It gives an additional argument in favour of the opinion
that the Energy Dialogue represented a specific substitute for the
ECT.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Security
of energy supply in Europe was obviously the key element of the
Energy Dialogue. A number of political and legal measures were
initially proposed in that area. As a starting point, the parties
highlighted the necessity to share adequately the risks between the
energy producers (investors) and the energy consumers.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Such
risk-sharing is essential in order to create the conditions for
long-term investment decisions in large-scale projects, on the one
hand, and guaranty the security of energy supply, on the other. At
present certain results in the sphere of energy security are evident
under the framework of the Energy Dialogue. The European Union
acknowledged the importance of the long-term contracts for the supply
of natural gas as such. The EU confirmed the absence of a 30 % limit
for the import of the fossil fuels from one external source.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">On
the one hand, it proves the impossibility for Europe to diversify the
import of oil and still more the import of natural gas. On the other
hand, it shows the necessity to develop a strategic cooperation with
Russia as the major energy exporter, which means that Russian energy
supplies should be stable and uninterruptible no matter how the
international situation evolves.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">From
the legal standpoint, the Energy Dialogue represents a permanent
consultative mechanism aimed at the development of international
relations in the energy sector. At present it does not provide for
the guaranties of EU energy security within the meaning of the
international law. Potentially, however, it may serve that purpose.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
general, the level of legal formalization of the security of energy
supplies from Russia to the EU does not adequately correspond to the
scale of international relations and the amount of supplies. The
enormous volumes of energy involved in the Russia-EU trade require a
solid legal basis. Of importance in this respect may be the policy,
currently being elaborated by the EU institutions. The said policy is
aimed at creating a single European energy market that should embrace
all European countries including Russia.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">It
is proposed to extend the basic principles of the EU law,
particularly the rules of competition, free movement of goods and
services, freedom of access to the energy infrastructure, to the
markets of the energy exporting countries. Such measures aimed at
energy prices reducing and establishing common requirements common
for producing and consuming countries to reduce the amount of the
natural rent received by producers. This can hardly coincide with the
economy guidelines and the energy security of the Russian Federation.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
order to adopt and implement an agreement which would be legally
binding and effective, the strategic interests of the Russian
Federation should be taken into consideration. First, Russian energy
companies are keen to gain access to downstream assets in EU member
states. They want to sell their goods and provide services to the
final consumers. Second, of importance to Russia are principles of
non-interruption of transit and inviolability of resources
transported.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">However,
the freedom of transit is definitely contrary to the interests of
Gazprom. Third, the emerging market players in Russian electricity
sector, which has undergone the liberalization processes, may be
looking forward to sell electricity in the EU-countries and hence
require the interconnection of the network systems.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">It
should also be noted that even if there is success in the first three
points, Russia would hardly accept EU competition rules. Such
acceptance would lead to significant interference in the corporate
structure of the energy companies in Russia. It is, of course,
impossible to follow completely the demands of Russia, but vice versa
it is illogical for Russia to accept all the requirements of the EU.
Therefore, the agreement should somehow identify a better balance of
interests.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
