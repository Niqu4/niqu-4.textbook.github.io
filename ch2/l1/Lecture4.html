<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">According
to the needs of energy, there have been different perceptions in
schools of thought about the definition of this concept. An attempt
was made to examine each theory about the situations of the
international energy security and ways that ensure the achievement of
this concept - whether through the use of force, or direct
cooperation and coordination or through international organizations
and institutions. However, the hard truth is that all countries in
the world are trying to use all means to achieve energy security,
which has become one of the most important constants in the foreign
policy of both the exporting and consuming countries. For
industrialized importing countries, energy security means getting
energy resources permanently, regularly and ensures supply of
consistently at reasonable prices. On the other hand, for energy
exporting countries, this concept means the discovery of new
quantities of different energy sources to ensure the continuation of
the export process in the long term. It also means using advanced
technology to increase production and reduce cost of exploration and
production operations, achieving stability of energy markets and not
lower prices, and safeguard their economic and political interests,
which would help sustain global need for the world to these sources,
and provide material liquidity and foreign investment to support the
exploration and development operations in support of the production.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
concept of energy security includes internal political stability of
the energy exporting countries, which is considered one of the most
important assistance factors to energy security. The best examples of
these are the events in Nigeria and Iraq, where internal unrest and
political instability and insecurity adversely affected the global
energy security. Regional stability, particularly in the energy
production regions, such as the Middle East and the Caspian Sea,
Africa and South America, is of utmost importance to support this
concept. Let us also not forget the security dimension of the energy
transfers through oil and gas pipelines spread in all continents and
through also oil tankers, liquefied gas that sail on the seas and
oceans, and the threat of increasing piracy rates which in the past
few years.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

stability and economic growth of the main industrial consumer
countries is one of the factors that supporting energy security, and,
at the same time, promote of the economic growth for the energy
exporting countries. There is also an environmental dimension of the
concept of energy security. All countries must either produce or
consume, taking into account all their plans to protect the
environment and mitigate the negative effects of production, transfer
and use of various energy sources. There is no energy security
without a good environment for human life. Through many factors are
affecting the concept of energy security, we can conclude that energy
security refers to a set of strategic, political, economic, and
environmental measures that should be taken by for all countries
(whether producers or consumers) to protect energy resources and keep
a continued flow to maintain economic development and social
progress. The responsibility for energy security lies not only on the
consuming countries, but on everyone, because the construction of an
integrated global energy security system will protect the interests
of all countries and help in promoting development and international
stability.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

independence, control over energy resources and provision of security
of the energy transportation routes have a great importance in terms
of political independence and national security. Energy will be the
main determinate of the 21th century. Driver of this determinate will
be oil and gas. Countries divided into three groups in terms of
energy resources:  1. Energy rich countries (Saudi Arabia, Russia,
Azerbaijan and etc.) whose economies dependent on energy revenues; 2.
Countries with high level of energy consumption (EU countries, US,
China, Japan, India and etc.) notwithstanding their own energy
resources; 3. Countries with their strategic position (Georgia,
Turkey, and etc.) between energy rich countries and energy-dependent
countries.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">There
are two types of energy resources: primary and secondary energy
resources. Primary energy resources also divided into two types:
renewable (unconventional) and conventional. Renewable
(environmentally friendly) resources (wind, solar, geothermal,
biomass, hydropower and tidal) can cover themselves no matter how
much they have been spent. Conventional resources (coal, oil,
uranium, and natural gas) are the fossil energy resources that cannot
cover themselves. Exploration and production of coal is very
expensive. The oil is more preferable and quickly depleted energy
resource because of its productivity. Uranium is also non-renewable
energy resource which used in nuclear energy production. In fact,
nuclear energy is the cleanest energy source and it doesn’t damage
environment during its production. However, in case of explosion and
penetration in Nuclear Power Plants it causes great damages for
environment and humanity (e.g. Third Mile Island-1979 and Chernobyl
accident-1986) which hard to compensate. There is also strict
reaction toward Nuclear Power Plants in community. However, natural
gas is an environmentally friendly energy resource which does not
pollute the air and nature. Secondary resources are electricity and
hydro energy which produced from primary resources.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

to Hans Morgenthau (the founder of modern realism), military power
(or hard power) is an important factor for any nation to be strong in
international politics. Hans Morgenthau listed followings elements
which compose the elements of hard power: “geography, natural
resources, industry capacity, military capacity, population, national
identity and moral power, qualified diplomacy and state”.
Morgenthau considers energy factor as a main element of hard power
and the most effective factor to determine the political power of
states. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

to James Dougherty and Robert Pfaltzgraff, military power is not
always capable to make government an effective power in the
international system and energy security will leave military security
in the shadow and will determine the position of government in the
international system. According to Michael Klare, energy resources
will not only replace the military power, but also will be reason for
armed conflicts and States could even use military power in order to
own energy resources. For example, the French-Germany War (1870) for
Ruhr coal basin, occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, relations of
U.S. with Iran until 1979s, occupation of Iraq by U.S. in 1990 and
2003.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

to Classic Realism, position of the government in regard to energy
resources in the international system depends on conflicts, interests
of strong states and mutual interaction among energy exporter,
importer and transit countries. In classic realism, governments
compete in order to increase their power. Power cannot be always
evaluated with material sources, but hard power sometimes requires
material elements. Energy rich countries can increase or decrease
their energy export in order to expand their influence.   </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

to the Kenneth Waltz (the founder of Neo-realism), reason for the
rivalry between governments is to gain power, because power provides
the security. Power of state is not derived from only energy
resources and these resources cannot influence to the manners of
states. But, due to Defensive Realism, states don’t seek for power,
but for security. According to Fareed Zakaria, increasing of power of
the states means the increasing of their securities. However, A.
Orban says that, ultimate goal of state is to gain power, not
security. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

policy, unless it is not used by the states to realize their goals.
Michael Klare says that, after the collapse of ideological conflict
between socialism and capitalism, and emergence of new economic
powers after the Cold War, international relations completely focused
on controlling of natural resources. These resources turned out to
rivalry and conflict tools among U.S, Russia, China, EU, Japan, India

consumption rate of countries gives information about their

of any country. Because, energy security is the important driver of

security is the frequently discussed issue in the contemporary
international relations. There are two different approaches toward
energy security concept. First one focused on energy, while other
focused on security notion. First notion (energy-focused) means
availability and accessibility of energy resources, while second
notion (security-focused) means provision of physical security of
energy exploration, development, production, transportation,
distribution, marketing, and consumption network against all types of
attacks. To sum up, Energy Security is a supply of energy resources
through continuously, reliable, clean, diversified sources and
countries on relevant quantities and prices, consumption of energy
resources with high-efficiency, transportation of energy resources
through secure routes without any threats, and energy efficiency in
the world.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

the Industrial Revolution, energy consumption is sharply increased
and obtaining of energy resources turned out to main political goals
of states. Because, the vast energy resources contribute to the
economy of countries, otherwise, lack of energy resources in the
country will make them dependent upon energy-rich countries. The role
of energy during World War I and II was undeniably crucial. Even, the
European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Atomic
Energy Community (EAEC), which constitutes the core of the European
Union, were established in order to provide co-existence on energy

possible to rescue other energy-depended countries from energy
hegemony of energy rich countries diversifying energy routes.
Diversification of energy routes will make easier to address country

Internal conflicts, terrorism and monopoly pose a great threat to the

security concept is a frequently used term in media and research
papers. Its definition limited with only its economic side and
majority does not pay attention to the political dimension. However,
energy factor was addressed to Europe as political weapon (Mikko
Palonkorpi). Another feature of the energy security is the
interdependence among states (e.g. Dependence of US and European
countries on Persian Gulf and Caspian basin’s energy resources).
However, there is not only unilateral dependence, but also
interdependence among countries. Because, energy-poor countries buy
oil and natural gas to provide the energy supply while energy rich
countries try to enhance the scope of their markets.    </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

to some analysts, energy resources (natural gas) were used for
political purposes. Because, there is not an international market of
natural gas as oil has. In this regard, Religious Leader of Iran,
Ayatollah Khomneyi and Russian President, Vladimir Putin intended to
establish natural Gas Cartel like OPEC. Another option in energy
security is the transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG). But,
transportation of LNG is more difficult and expensive in comparison

security also has a great influence to regional balances and
historical friendship and hostility relationships. For instance, the
biggest goal of Russia being a super power jeopardizes the future of
other energy powers and pushes forward for polarization. Because, the
majority of hydrocarbon resources concentrated in Russia, Middle
East, Caspian Basin and Northern Africa. Therefore, the global energy
super power might be four-polar in the future.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

majority of oil reserves condensates in Persian Gulf (Iran, Iraq,
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait) and Russia. Therefore, oil exporter
countries established OPEC in order to gain control over oil markets

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Political
results of energy dependence increasing more and more. Under the flag
of “War with Terrorism” US kept its military presence in Iraq and
Afghanistan for a long time. Suez Crisis (1956), Arab oil embargos
(1973), Iran-Iraq war (1980), and two Gulf Wars (1990 and 2003)
demonstrated the importance of oil in international relations. Some
oil-rich countries (Iran and Venezuela) use oil to secure their
authority in the region, as it is a pure evidence of
petro-nationalism. During and after Cold War, military and diplomatic
presence of U.S. in Middle East, Latin America, South Caucasus and
Central Asia directly related to his energy – oil and gas
interests. Energy security turned out political issue not in 1970s,
but today. Dependence on and import of oil and natural gas continues
to increase. Possibly, one might approach to energy security from
three points of view: firstly, physically – energy resources
depleting; secondly, economically - its prices is increasing;
thirdly, politically – energy used as a political tool by some
states.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
