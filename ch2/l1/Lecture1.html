<p>Energy is the cornerstone of social progress and economic growth. Therefore, since the beginning of this century, energy is taking a central place for economic development and social progress of nations around the world. Today, more than 80% of the global energy needs are met by fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the global reserves of these scarce and non-renewable resources are very limited and located in a few countries in the world, such as the Middle East, which is one of the largest energy providers in the world. However, at the same time, this is the main cause for conflict in the world. We have had numerous instances of denial of access to energy sources in times of conflict and war in this volatile region. This happened in 1973 in the global energy crisis that followed the Arab-Israeli War and the Arab oil embargo on the countries of Europe, Japan and America. This led to economic and social upheavals in the world due to a lack of supply and high prices of petroleum products.</p>
<p>The 1973 oil crisis triggered a rethink about the concept of energy security. The crisis exposed the vulnerability of the economics of the major countries in dealing with the energy crises. Therefore, a need was felt for having a new concept of energy security to ensure constant supplies of energy, particularly from the Middle East, which had the largest reserves of oil and gas in the world.</p>
<p>The energy crisis in 1973 brought about a major shift in international relations and set in motion the process of creation of an international organization (like the International Energy Agency (IEA), founded in November 1974) to ensure international cooperation and coordination, and a constant and stable supply of energy.</p>
<p>The IEA was set up with the following objectives:</p>
<p> Enhance energy security among member states in order to achieve a collective response to any disturbance in the energy market and to provide the necessary research in order to ensure a reliable and cheap energy for all member states.</p>
<p> Implementation of comprehensive programs of cooperation and coordination between member states and build strategic storage of energy to cope with any sudden strike disorders.</p>
<p> Encouraging the adoption of sustainable energy policies, in order to stimulate economic growth and protect the environment and, in particular, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.</p>
<p> Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of energy data.</p>
<p> Providing support for global cooperation in the field of energy technology and the exchange of information, to find alternative resources and improve the efficiency of current energy system.</p>
<p> The quest to find lasting solutions to the problems of the world's energy through cooperation and coordination with countries that are not members and with international and regional organization.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency added a new dimension to the concept of energy security through collective and collaborative action to ensure promotion and protection of global energy security, which is no longer confined to a particular country, but the concept became an international concept, since it was felt that energy security can only be achieved through collective international action to protect the economies from any future disruptions.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency was founded in response to the oil crisis of 1973 to ensure stable oil supplies as a part of an international perspective to achieve this goal. The oil-producing countries responded to the global energy crises, that was threatening the security of energy, by establishing appropriate regional and international organizations.</p>
<p>Opencast was founded in 1960, in order to achieve cooperation and coordination between the Petroleum Exporting Countries so as to achieve stability in the international oil markets and eliminate harmful sudden fluctuations and to maintain the interests of the member states permanently in order to achieve a steady income and secure a steady supply of energy to the consumer countries.</p>
<p>The interpretation of energy security, as a holistic concept, differs from one state to another according to the needs of the concerned state. Energy security for the energy exporting countries refers to the continuous access to international energy markets for the sale of energy resources. While the energy security for importing countries, refers to assured access to a continuous supply of energy at affordable prices, in order to maintain economic growth and social progress. For the U.S., energy security means &ldquo;producing energy at home and relying less on foreigners;&rdquo; for China, it might mean &ldquo;buying stakes in foreign oil fields;&rdquo; for Russia, it is wrapped up in &ldquo;restrictions on foreign investment in domestic oil and natural gas;&rdquo; while for Japan the focus is on &ldquo;offsetting its scarcity of domestic resources through diversification, trade and investment.&rdquo; It is natural for each country to give priority to its own energy needs, but all of these needs must be reconciled, if true energy security is to be attained.</p>
<p>According to experts: The critical relevance of this concept for India, for example, emanates from a growing imbalance between the demand for energy and its supply from indigenous sources, implying, therefore, a growing dependence on imports.</p>
<p>Energy security is term we often here these days, especially when we are listening different reports about the world running out of oil. The best way to define energy security is to say that this term refers to availability of natural resources for energy consumption in a given period of time (short or long-term period in order to estimate future energy security).</p>
<p>Each country must think about its future energy security because this is one of the main prerequisites for the future economic growth. Our economy is traditionally based on fossil fuels (oil, coal and natural gas), and this fact leads to conclusion that only the adequate supply of fossil fuels can guarantee future energy security.</p>
<p>The transition to renewable energy could change this but all current estimates say that our economy will continue its dependence on fossil fuels till at least the end of the century. Under this scenario fossil fuels will continue to determine the destiny of future global energy security and oil will likely continue to shape up the global economic growth.</p>
<p>The role of renewable energy in improving energy security is not to be overlooked because more renewable energy coming from domestic renewable energy sources means less need for fossil fuels and expensive foreign fuel import. Going for more domestic energy resources instead of relying on expensive foreign fuel import is very positive thing for future energy security.</p>
<p>The bigger percentage of renewable energy sources in country's energy portfolio also means improved energy independence. Energy independence and energy security are two closely connected terms, basically in most cases improved energy security means also improved energy independence.</p>
<p>There are many different threats to energy security, for instance political turmoil in rich oil producing countries, the rise of new economic giants (China and India that present heavy competition over energy sources), natural disasters and accidents, etc.</p>
<p>Also, energy security doesn't refer just to the amount of energy resources that are at disposal to certain country but also to a security of energy supply (adequate distribution network). Energy plays key role in the national security of any given country because without energy there's no economy, and without economy there's no progress of society in general.</p>
<p>Major oil exporters today play key role in global energy security. Many powerful countries are looking for long-term solutions to increase energy security by reducing dependence on foreign oil import. This has not only resulted in the growth of domestic renewable energy resources but also in different measures aimed to improve energy efficiency and energy conservation.</p>
<p>The energy security <em>per se</em> stems from a number of complex factors, related to international trade, supply and pricing.</p>
<p>It is imperative to distinguish between the two sources, oil and gas, since they have different characteristics from the perspective of energy security. Unlike oil, gas is relatively difficult to store and gas transportation infrastructure is rigid in nature (for the time being). This means that a physical link between producer and consumer is required and the number of alternative routes to the consumer is limited. For example, a cargo of oil destined for the UK can easily be switched and sent to another country in another continent: this is actually an everyday occurrence, whereas for gas this flexible switching does not happen. This is because, unlike gas, oil transportation is not costly, and therefore oil that is destined for a specific place can easily be redirected to another destination. Moreover, unlike the global oil market, the gas market is regional. A global oil market implies that a disruption of oil supply in one part of the world may affect the whole world whereas gas disruption does not necessarily have worldwide repercussions. This is again due to the fact that firstly, the costs of gas transportation are higher than oil, and delivery systems are inflexible, and secondly, gas development in one country or region is isolated (due to a lack of easy switching between routes) from the development of other regions, which suggests that disruption in one region does not necessarily influence another. Another difference between oil and gas is that seven cases of oil disruption have been reported since 1950, occurring for purely political rather than physical reasons, whereas no gas disruptions have occurred and if they did, were only minor and short-term. This last difference shows that oil has historically been used as a political weapon while gas does not have such political characteristics. (The most significant example of politically motivated gas disruption was the blockage of gas exports from Russia to Ukraine in early January 2006. This blockage lasted only four days, and the political motives behind it are controversial and are not widely accepted). In addition, gas security is mostly concerned with physical shortage rather than price shocks, the latter being an oil security concern (for example, the energy crisis of 1973 was about the high price of oil and at no time was the physical availability of oil endangered).</p>
<p>There are debates over what constitutes energy security and these arguments have been sometimes hindered by a lack of clear understanding concerning the different components of the energy security problem and their policy implications. The multi-faceted nature of energy security, which will be elaborated below, makes it very difficult to provide a definition of energy security that is accepted by all. A commonly accepted practical definition of this concept is <em>adequacy of energy supply at a reasonable price</em>. This definition suggests that energy should be physically available and its price should be reasonable.</p>
<p>There is also a subtle difference between the definition of oil and gas security. Gas security could be defined as the <em>"guarantee that all the gas volumes demanded </em>by <em>customers will be available at a reasonable price".</em> Oil security means <em>"reliable and adequate supply of energy for a reasonable price"</em>. The difference between these two definitions is that gas security necessitates the satisfaction of demand without necessarily emphasizing the adequacy of gas supplies in all sectors. If one particular sector normally uses gas, but gas cannot be obtained, then it can be substituted by other fuels, such as coal or oil. The same does not apply to oil there are sectors in which oil is the dominant source of energy and no other energy can currently substitute it, such as the domain of transport in the European Union. Consequently, if there is no oil reaching that sector, the sector cannot function. In this case, as the oil market is a global market, a major shock anywhere in the world will be felt throughout the world oil market. The global nature of the oil market has prompted some to suggest that even if an energy-producing country could magically and inexpensively raise its domestic output to eliminate total imports, a shock in the world oil market will affect its domestic price and threaten the stability of its economy. Therefore, efforts to combat oil insecurity should also be made at the global level.</p>
