national oil companies (NOCs) are increasing their control of
reserves and production. To some degree, NOCs, many of which are very
competent in managing oil exploration and production, serve the
political interests of their governments, which view their oil
resource as a means to advance political objectives, in addition to
obtaining revenue. The result is an increasing trend toward
state-to-state agreements between producers and consumers, especially
the new consumer countries. A noteworthy example is China’s
arrangements with Angola and Sudan. State-to-state agreements are an
undesirable move away from open and transparent world oil markets,
toward the use of oil as an instrument to influence political
outcomes.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Here
are factors of energy security that emerged as researchers noted and
thought about them:</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">• <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>Affordability.</I></SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">
The importance of price asserted itself quickly in the NESA Center
forum’s discussion of energy security. It does so in any realistic
conversation about the subject. But not all such conversations are
realistic.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">• <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>Environmental
acceptability.</I></SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">
Most conversations about energy treat the environment and security as
discrete matters to be dealt with accordingly. Maybe that’s because
each topic is so big and contentious that treating them as mere parts
of a larger whole seems unwieldy beyond hope. Maybe that’s wrong.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">• <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>Durability
of supply</I></SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">.
Security means energy flows can withstand and adapt to the
interruption of supply. The threat to energy flows can take many
forms. In the past few years, major disruptions have come from
hurricanes, revolutions, labor strikes, and war. In Rome, talk about
what might interrupt energy supplies tended to focus on terrorism.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">• <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>Diversification
of source.</I></SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">
Of course, durability of supply improves as the number of suppliers’
increases. This is easy to see. If terrorism is the main threat to
energy flows, diversification lifts the number of targets terrorists
must hit if they’re to create general economic havoc. Less noticed
in a terrorized age, although no less important, is diversification’s
relationship to another element of security: price. The more sellers
exist of something; the less able any one seller can be to raise
prices without losing customers.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">• <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>Sufficiency
relative to demand.</I></SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">
Unmet need does nothing constructive for security; by raising prices,
in fact, it does quite the opposite (see above on affordability).</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">• <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>Relationship
with water.</I></SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">
As an issue of supply security, water is at least as pressing as
energy. Increasingly, the two issues are linked. Meeting the world’s
growing demand for fresh water requires rising amounts of energy.
Meeting growing demand for energy requires rising amounts of water.
Arid countries understand these relationships. That some countries
represented in Rome are arid helped illuminate an important dynamic
of security with which all countries soon will grapple.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">• <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>Equity
among nations</I></SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">.
Some countries have lots of oil, some lots of money, and some lots of
both. Some countries have little of either but lots of hungry people.
This is a security problem.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">• <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>Relationships
among nations.</I></SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">
Energy trade isn’t just business; it’s geopolitics, too. Quick:
What leaps to mind, business or politics, at the mention of these
words? Iran. Ukraine. Orinoco. Key stone.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">• <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>The
morality of consumption</I></SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">.
That the morality of consumption came up in a discussion about energy
security that encompassed elements such as equity among nations,
water, and the environment was interesting. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>
