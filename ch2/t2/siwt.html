the policy of the USA the goal of  any  campaign  to  fight 
terrorists  is  homeland  security:  protection  of  the population.
A strategy to reach this goal must rest on an empirical understanding
of the enemy‘s behavior. To gain such understanding, a
comprehensive, quantitative review of all operations in the West,
either linked to or in the name of ―al Qaeda,</SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Cambria Math, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">

crisis in Syria is one of the most important reasons why ISIS grew
capable of mounting such an effective attack on the Iraqi government.
The chaos in Syria allowed ISIS to hold this territory pretty
securely. This is a big deal in terms of weaponry and money. “The
war gave them a lot of access to heavy weaponry”, Michael Knights
said. ISIS also “has a funding stream available to them because of
local businesses and the oil and gas sector”.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">It's
also hugely important as a safe zone. When fighting Syrian troops,
ISIS can safely retreat to Iraq; when fighting Iraqis it can go to
Syria. Statistical evidence says these safe “rear areas” help
insurgents win: “one of the best predictors of insurgent success
that we have to date is the presence of a rear area”, Jason Lyall
said.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

is no clear doctrine on the use of existing strategic reserves in
Europe. There are many reasons, and many of them are quite
convincing. For example, governments do not want to interfere in
pricing, because, first, it is expensive, and secondly, the
intervention is doomed to failure. There is little sense in the EU
proposal on the establishment of a strategic reserve controlled by
the European Commission to conduct countercyclical interventions, it
has been sharply criticized by most experts - both practitioners and
theorists, and must be dismissed. It has long been stipulated by
economists, but in practice it did not find its solution. Therefore
researchers state that it is best to treat strategic reserves as
belonging to the state.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

oil industry can no longer rely on its monopoly of the transport
market. The vehicle industry is replacing oil with more efficient
vehicles, and biofuels are replacing oil products as liquid fuels.
This is driven both by the increase in oil prices since 2005, and by
government policies limiting carbon emissions. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Since
2011 all major importing countries have adopted strong policies on
carbon emissions and vehicle efficiency. These secure markets for
efficient automobiles, rather than for oil. As current policies are
unlikely to achieve their aims, it is probable that stronger policies
will be introduced. The result will be to flatten and reverse growth
in the use of petroleum in transport in developed countries, and slow
its growth in developing countries.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
