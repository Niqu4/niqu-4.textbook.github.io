<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">There
are two main points to keep in mind when examining the implications
of the shale revolution from the viewpoint of national security. The
first is its impact on so-called “energy security,” and the
second is its effects on the wider field of international relations
and its geopolitical implications, including energy security
concerns.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
a country’s energy security policy, the government strives to
support the national economy by ensuring the reliable supply of
energy at affordable prices. Short-term risks attached to such a
strategy include supply disruptions, or sharp price volatility,
caused by civil unrest, or by natural disasters. Over the medium
term, risks include supply shortages or environmental issues arising
from underinvestment in exploration and development, or necessary
infrastructure. At the same time, there is also the impact of
developments in energy supply on a wide range of international
relations, including geopolitical implications, at the core of which
lies market domination by some producing countries, and the
utilization of energy supplies by such countries for specific
political ends. In such cases, suppliers may withhold energy
supplies, in the manner of a hostage, so as to coerce consumer
countries into falling in line with their political desires. This is
an issue that touches on the question of national sovereignty.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Principal
countermeasures against energy security risks include diversification
of energy sources and sources of supply, as well as steps to
stabilize supply routes, in addition to the construction of an
emergency stockholding system based on international cooperation. In
other words, the prime focus is on constructing a series of mutually
complementary systems to ensure that market mechanisms operate in a
stable fashion. Regarding energy trade issues related to national
sovereignty, as the root cause of any problems would lie in the
intentions of the energy-supplying countries in question; the most
fundamental form of countermeasures would consist of steps to render
it meaningless for such countries to put those intentions into
practice. In practice, it would be most effective to reduce one’s
dependence on specific c suppliers, and in its most extreme form,
this would involve the establishment of a system of complete energy
self-sufficiency. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
view of these factors, our discussion of the shale revolution in this
chapter will be guided by two focuses. First, we will examine—in
the context of the need to stabilize the global energy market—the
question of whether the shale revolution is likely to facilitate a
sustainably adequate supply of oil and gas to the market and the
diversification of supply sources and routes. Second, we will explore
whether the revolution is likely to improve the energy
self-sufficiency of the United States and other energy importing
countries. Specifically, we will discuss the likelihood for those
countries to adopt the shale technologies developed in the United
States and use them to expand commercial production of shale oil and
gas. In the following section, we will first examine the current
state of shale oil and gas production in the United States, and its
impact.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
IEA estimates that production of shale oil in the United States will
peak out around the year 2020. However, as oil consumption in the
United States is likely to follow a continuous and gradual declining
trend, due to energy conservation measures among other factors, the
country’s imports of crude oil will decline to around 40 percent of
the present level by 2035, at 3.4 million barrels per day, and US
dependence on oil imports will fall below 30 percent of its total oil
needs. The IEA also projects that the United States may become a net
exporter of crude oil by 2030 or thereabouts. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Conversely,
the IEA warns that the United States is not likely to be completely
immune to the effects of developments on the global crude oil market,
despite its improved energy self-sufficiency rate. In other words, as
fluctuations in the price of crude oil, which is an international
commodity, will affect the average US consumer, the country cannot
afford to remain indifferent toward its interests in the sphere of
national security, such as measures to maintain a steady supply of
crude oil to the global market and thereby stabilize international
crude oil prices. The geopolitical attention of the US authorities
will thus remain focused principally on the countries of the Middle
East. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Regarding
the reliability of the data that lies behind the above-quoted views
of the IEA regarding future shale oil production trends in the United
States and the continued importance of the Middle East from the
standpoint of energy security (as well as the IEA’s analysis of
that data), it is worth noting that the IEA’s conclusions are
shared by the British international oil major BP PLC, whose forecasts
for the global energy situation up to 2030 are shown below. Oil
production by nonmembers of OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries)—led by production of shale oil in the United
States—will continue to increase up to around 2020, but this growth
will come to an end soon after 2020, and is then likely to soon begin
trending downward.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">During
this period, consumers are expected to reduce their consumption of
oil amid persistently high international crude oil prices, and the
OPEC members are not likely to take unreasonable steps to increase
their production volume. After 2020, however, as oil production
volume by non-OPEC countries declines, the OPEC members, who will
still possess production capacity to spare, are forecast to begin
increasing their output. In short, the analysis suggests no
diminution in the importance of OPEC, an organization whose main
members are in the Middle East.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Meanwhile,
as the volume of crude oil imported by the United States is
decreasing, that of a number of countries in Asia—notably China and
India—is expected to grow. As a result, Asian destinations will
account for a sharply increased percentage of total crude oil exports
from the Middle East and Africa. In turn, the increased volume of
total world trade in crude oil transported by sea will be forced to
pass through chokepoints on the routes to Asia. In terms of global
energy security, this means that greater risk will be entailed in
passage through certain chokepoints, such as the Hormuz Strait at the
entrance to the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Malacca between
Malaysia and Indonesia. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">This
means that, with regard to ensuring the safety of maritime crude oil
transit routes, and with respect to building up strategic oil
stockpiles and drawing on those stockpiles as appropriate (stock
draw), the strengthening of the international system of
cooperation—including with the participation of China and
India—will become even more vital than at the moment. With respect
to this issue, the IEA adopts a very positive stance on taking steps
to circumvent the riskier chokepoints, such as constructing oil
pipelines across the Arabian Peninsula or across Myanmar to China. In
line with this, the IEA is calling on both China and India to
participate more positively in such international collaborative
projects.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Rarely,
if ever, in postwar history has the world been confronted with
problems as serious as those caused by recent changes in the supply
and price conditions of the world oil trade. To put these changes
into proper perspective, they must be evaluated not only in economic
and financial terms but also in the framework of their political and
strategic implications.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">I
need not dwell here on the overwhelming importance of oil for the
energy requirements of every country in the world; nor do I plan to
elaborate on the fact that-except for the United States, the Soviet
Union and a small number of countries that are, or will become,
self-sufficient-most of the nations of the world will, at least for
the foreseeable future, depend almost entirely on imports from a
handful of oil-exporting countries, with an overwhelming
concentration of oil production and reserves in the Persian Gulf area
of the Middle East. Among those countries in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia
is predominant in terms of reserves, production, and most important,
in the potential to provide significant expansion of supplies.
Inevitably, producing decisions by Middle East governments,
especially Saudi Arabia, will play a pivotal role in future world oil
availability and pricing.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Over
the last three years or so, oil-producing countries have in fact
taken over complete control of the oil industry in their countries.
They have coordinated their efforts through the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) which was established in 1960.
Since 1970, producing governments have imposed in rapid succession
changes in previous agreements that had been negotiated and
renegotiated with their concession-holding companies, predominantly
affiliates of the Anglo-American international oil companies. These
changes were arrived at under the threat that if the oil companies
would not acquiesce, the producing countries would legislate such
changes unilaterally or expropriate the concessions. In October 1973
the last vestige of negotiations was abandoned and producing
governments unilaterally set posted prices on their oil.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
the exercise of this power, Middle East producing countries have
raised their government oil revenues from taxes and royalties from
about 90 cents per barrel in 1970 to about $3.00 per barrel by
October 1973 and then to $7.00 per barrel by January 1974. In
addition, as a result of the participation agreements between the
producing countries and the oil companies, the governments earn
additional income from the sale of their newly acquired oil. Its
amount, of course, depends on the percent of government ownership and
the price they charge for their oil. Agreements had been concluded,
as recently as late 1972, under which producing countries acquired a
25 percent participation in the oil-producing operations and were
also committed to sell most of their participation oil to the oil
companies at agreed-upon prices; now producing countries are
demanding that these arrangements be changed in their favor. Only a
few arrangements have yet been concluded, but most of the producing
countries will probably insist on at least the equivalent of 60
percent participation and a price for the sale of their oil
corresponding to about 93 percent of the posted price-both changes
most likely to be imposed with retroactive effect as of January 1,
1974. On such a basis, the government income from the total
oil-producing operations in key countries would average about $9.25
per barrel.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Meanwhile,
the oil income of the Middle East producing countries has increased
from $4 billion in 1970 to $9 billion in 1972 and to a presently
estimated $60 billion in 1974. The oil revenues of all OPEC countries
are increasing from $15 billion in 1972 to nearly $100 billion in
1974. Allowing for all their own foreign exchange requirements, OPEC
producing countries will still have available surplus revenues on the
order of $60 billion this year alone. And there remains a clear and
present danger that under conditions as they exist now, the supply of
oil from individual producing countries or a group of them to
individual importing countries or a group of them might-as in October
1973-at a time unknown, again be curtailed or completely cut off for
a variety of economic, political, strategic, or other reasons.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
quick pace at which the producing countries have affected his radical
shift in the balance of power is perhaps the most dangerous aspect of
the current situation. Whatever the merits of their case (of which
more later), the world faces frightening repercussions on account of
the suddenness with which oil costs of importing countries and oil
revenues of producing countries have been inflated. There just has
been no time for mature consideration by the societies that have to
deal with this new exercise of oil and financial power, be they
recipients or dependents, producers or consumers.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
security of international oil supply operations is further affected
by regional conflicts in the producing areas of the Middle East-in
particular the still unresolved issues posed by the Israeli-Arab
confrontation. There are other potentially dangerous and divisive
possibilities, as reflected in Iran's policy of establishing herself
as the major strategic power in the Persian Gulf and the Indian
Ocean. This could, in due course, aggravate what is already a latent
conflict between Iran and some of the Arab countries-not only Iraq,
where the hostilities are acute, but perhaps even Saudi Arabia. There
are also disputes between Iraq and Kuwait, unresolved boundary issues
between Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, and internal conflicts such as
the Kurdish problem in Iraq. Further problems are posed by inherently
unstable governments in many of these areas and by uncertain and
unpredictable rules for the succession to power.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Moreover,
within the Persian Gulf area there are varying economic and strategic
relationships between some of the producing countries and Western
powers on the one hand, and the Soviet Union and even Communist
China-on the other. Moscow is deeply involved in Middle East affairs
and with the strategic and national policies of some countries,
particularly Iraq and Syria. As the producing countries increasingly
assert their oil and money power, they are also likely to become
increasingly involved as hostage or pawn in any major power struggle.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">How
can the nations of the world handle this new situation? What is the
role of the international oil companies? Above all, how can the
producing and importing nations avoid a confrontation or simply a
series of reciprocal actions that must tend more and more toward
economic chaos and grave political danger? Is there a way to
reconcile the various national interests and to achieve constructive
overall cooperation?</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
first key fact that must now be recognized is that the position of
the international oil companies has changed completely over the past
few years. Up to about 1969 the major concession-holding companies
still could determine levels of production, investments, exports and
prices. Moreover, they still possessed substantial bargaining
leverage in their negotiations with producing countries, largely by
virtue of the surplus producing capacity that obtained in the Middle
East, and even in the United States into the latter sixties.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">All
this has now gone. The producing countries have taken over from the
companies the power to set production levels, to designate or embargo
export destinations, to direct investments and to set prices. The
oil-producing affiliates of the international oil companies have
become completely subservient to the directives issued by the
oil-producing countries. Nothing perhaps reflects the present state
of affairs more dramatically than the fact that American- and
Dutch-owned oil companies had no choice last fall but to become the
instruments for carrying out the embargo on oil shipments to their
own home countries.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Thus,
the companies no longer possess any real leverage. About the only
role that is, in effect, left to them in established producing areas
is that of a contractor providing technical services, getting in
return some privileged access to oil-at costs and prices determined
by producing governments. The extent of even this “privilege” and
the time over which it will be available are subject to unilateral
cancellation at any moment, as were all preceding arrangements.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">At
the same time that they have been deprived of effective control over
their producing operations, the role of the international oil
companies in consuming countries has come under increasing fire,
fueled also by the recent sudden increase in company profits. During
the emergency, consuming governments largely abdicated any effective
role; the companies thus had to make far-ranging decisions as to
allocation of supplies, pricing, treatment of nonintegrated
companies, and many other issues. It was the companies that kept
sufficient supplies moving to all countries; now, after the event,
some of their decisions are being challenged by consuming
governments. It is extremely doubtful whether the companies still
possess the necessary flexibility to cope with another similar
crisis.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">If
the role of the major international oil companies in established
producing areas is diminished, it is nonetheless important to
understand what their remaining position is. The technical services
they can provide are extensive, and vital to continuing development
of the producing countries' resources as well as to efficient
producing operations. Moreover, none of the producing countries is
prepared to handle alone the disposition of the huge volumes of
production they control: the downstream facilities of the majors
provide assured outlets for the mainstream of their production, while
remaining quantities of crude can be sold directly or used to support
refining and petrochemical production in their own countries or in
joint ventures abroad.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Because
of their size, scope, technical competence and financial strength,
coupled with their important positions in the production and
development of oil, gas, coal, shale, tar sands, and atomic resources
in areas politically secure, the international oil companies are
bound to play a major-if not the major-role in expanding dependable
additional sources of energy supplies. Even though their foreign
crude oil resource base is subject to progressive erosion, the major
internationals will accordingly continue to provide for the importing
countries over the years ahead the most flexible sources of energy
supply.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">However,
the international oil companies are no longer able to assure the
continuity or price of regular supplies to oil-importing countries.
And while they can hope to maintain continued preferred access to
substantial production in support of their affiliates’ crude
requirements, even that is uncertain and contingent on the producing
countries' self-interest in extending such off take rights.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Downstream
investment in refining, marketing, and transport thus tends to become
extremely risky, because the viability of such investment is
predicated on secure supplies. Meanwhile, as a logical part of their
own development program, producing countries is using their control
over crude availability to spur refining and petrochemical investment
in their own countries and to acquire tanker fleets-all of which will
in due course add to consuming countries' foreign exchange import
costs and adversely affect the flexibility and security of their
supplies.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
the circumstances, oil-importing countries can no longer expect the
companies to fulfill their earlier most important role, as an
effective intermediary between the interests of producing and
consuming countries. Nor can the international oil companies
function, as in the past, effectively to preclude direct dealings
between importing and producing countries relating to oil supplies,
prices, etc., which may easily lead to political confrontations. To
the extent that the companies maintain their operations in producing
countries, they in fact reflect the producing governments' economic,
political, and strategic policies. To be able to hold on to whatever
tenuous residual rights or preferences the producing countries might
still be willing to extend, the companies will have no choice but to
acquiesce in virtually any kind of conditions imposed or exacted.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">All
this points to a far greater involvement by consuming-country
governments in oil industry operations than heretofore. One major
objective will be greater “transparency” in oil company policies.
Oil-importing countries cannot be in the dark with respect to
negotiations in producing areas, when the decisions vitally affect
the security and price of their essential oil supplies. They will
want to know more about investment plans and policies in their own
countries. And with transparency will inevitably come progressively
more government interposition throughout internal oil economies.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">But
here, too, the international oil companies will have a continuing
role to play. Producing countries will become increasingly involved
downstream, as direct crude sellers and through investment. Consuming
countries will become increasingly involved upstream, through various
exploration and crude arrangements. Within this emerging
fragmentation of world oil trade, the integrated facilities of the
companies could provide an important, perhaps the major, core of
efficient operations.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
sum, whatever arrangements on supply, financing, and pricing the oil
companies may still be able to conclude formally with producing
countries, in practice and underlying reality such arrangements
cannot be ignored by the importing countries but are bound to be
decisively affected by their policies. Moreover, with the vital
concern the importing countries have not only for price but for
availability of oil, it now appears inevitable that their governments
will also in due course establish a comprehensive policy of
surveillance and consultation-perhaps even some measure of
control-with regard to oil company operations encompassing the whole
range of oil activities vitally affecting their countries.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
