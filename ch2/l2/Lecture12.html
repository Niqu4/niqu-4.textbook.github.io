observers take the view that the shale revolution promises to free
Europe from the shackles of Russian market domination, but Russia and
Europe are linked by a complex web of energy-related
interdependencies whose historical roots go back a long way, and the
probable reactions of the two sides to the shale revolution will
likewise be complex.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
discussing the situation in which the Russian government finds
itself, we should first note that the oil and gas sector accounts for
almost 50 percent of the total revenues and more than 60 percent of
the export earnings of the government of the Russian Federation. On a
simple comparison of export earnings, crude oil exports came to
US$180.93 billion in 2012, roughly three times higher than exports of
natural gas, at US $62.25 billion. Turning to Russia’s domestic
consumption of primary energy, on the other hand, whereas oil
accounted for around 20 percent, natural gas accounted for over 50
percent and was the leading form of energy consumed by the electric
power generation, household consumption, and industrial consumption
sectors. Up to now, the Russian authorities have always held down the
selling price of natural gas on the domestic market to assist the
standard of living of ordinary households. At the same time, by
helping to just barely prop up the international competitiveness of
Russian industry, exports of natural gas have a special significance
for the country.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">That
is to say, the Russian authorities must at all costs ensure the
continued steady supply of natural gas at low prices in the domestic
market in order to shore up the economy, and for this purpose,
continued prospecting for natural gas, followed by drilling and
production, is essential. For this reason, the Russians must export
gas at a scale that allows them to recoup the investment costs
involved. The main market for Russian gas is Europe, which accounts
for roughly 80 percent of Russia’s total energy export earnings,
while Russian natural gas accounts for about 25 percent of total
European gas imports. Thus, in this field, the relationship between
the two sides is one of mutual dependence.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">As
a result of the economic turmoil that followed the breakup of the
Soviet Union, including rapid privatization, Russia’s energy
industry underwent much deterioration. Other industrial sectors also
stagnated, and the country’s overall economic base was weakened. In
response to this situation, following his election as president of
Russia in 2000, Vladimir Putin positioned the revitalization of the
energy industry as the key to economic recovery, and undertook a
program of reorganizing the energy sector, including extensive
renationalization of companies in this sector. At the same time,
Putin ordered increased investment in drilling and production of oil
and gas resources in Western Siberia in order to maintain the
region’s production capacity, which was initially developed in the
1970s but had been going downhill for many years. He also laid down a
policy of developing Russia’s promising energy resources in Eastern
Siberia and Russia’s Far East region to serve as the country’s
main base for future energy production. These factors constituted the
background to the 2003 Energy Strategy.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
Russians were encouraged to pursue this strategy by the persistent
uptrend of global oil prices from 2003 onwards, and demand from their
principal export market of Europe expanded firmly. Long-term
contracts for natural gas in which the prices are linked to those of
oil—which now constitutes a problem for Russia—were not
considered problematic at that time, and were thought necessary to
secure the investment funds required for a stable supply of gas in
the future. However, European countries had adopted a policy of
reducing their reliance on hydrocarbon resources over the long term
to minimize environmental impact. Moreover, as a result of Russia’s
temporary cutoff of natural gas supplies to Ukraine in January
2006—as the culmination of the two countries’ dispute over
prices—the European Union proclaimed a policy of diversifying its
gas supply sources to further reduce dependence on Russia. This
policy was incorporated in the EU’s first official energy policy
document, published in January 2007.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
response, in a similar manner, the Russian government decided to
commence full-fledged entry into the East Asian energy market—a
move it had been studying since 2005—to reduce its dependence on
the European market over the long term. This policy was embodied in
the Eastern Gas Program, which was approved by the government in
September 2007. This program included plans for gas development on
Sakhalin and for the construction of an LNG terminal at
Vladivostok—both of which are currently attracting attention in
energy circles—and a plan to construct a pipeline for transporting
gas to China. These plans were part of a wider concept of promoting
the development of gas fields in Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far
East region to serve as energy sources for the East Asian market and
in turn to stimulate general economic development in those parts of
Russia. Against the backdrop of international crude oil prices moving
at consistently high levels, Russia was able to take a long-term
perspective on the development of gas fields with an eye to supplying
the gas to the East Asian market.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">As
a result of the global financial crisis that unfolded toward the end
of the 2000s, however, there was a complete about-face in this
favorable environment, amid which Russia had had considerable room to
maneuver. Global oil prices fell sharply; demand from Russia’s
principal market of Europe declined, and the country posted a
decrease in energy export earnings, which was a severe blow to the
economy as a whole. The situation was then aggravated by the dispute
with Ukraine over gas prices and debts, resulting in the cessation of
gas supplies to and via Ukraine in January 2009. The European Union
took action to further reduce its dependence on Russia for energy
supplies, and announced a policy of promoting further liberalization
of the energy market within the EU in order to ensure energy supply
flexibility. The EU also strongly requested Russia to abolish
discriminatory price-setting practices and the setting of
unreasonable restrictions on gas delivery destinations, among other
measures.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
the face of this situation, the Russian government was forced to
direct its full efforts into diversifying its energy export
markets—with a prime focus on East Asia, where demand was forecast
to grow—and into securing sufficient funds for the necessary
investment. It was amid these circumstances that the 2009 Energy
Strategy was drawn up. Among the new export markets for Russian
natural gas that were considered as part of the diversification
policy was the United States, where a steep increase in imports was
predicted, and for this reason Russia commenced development of the
Shtokman field in the Barents Sea and of gas fields on the Yamal
Peninsula, both of which lie within the Arctic Circle.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
development of gas fields in Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East
with a view to selling the gas on East Asian markets will require not
only the construction of production facilities, but also one or more
massive pipelines, as the gas fields are located far inland. For this
reason, in order to recoup the massive initial investment involved,
Russia needed to be sure of a sufficient level of demand and
prospects for long-term contracts that would enable an adequate
profit yield. Consequently, while the 2009 Energy Strategy document
called for Russia’s entry into the East Asian market, against the
background of severe budgetary constraints, up to the final
investment decision, the authorities were forced to adopt an
extremely cautious stance on everything involved, including the
contract negotiations. Moreover, to fulfill its obligations under the
long-term contracts it had signed with European countries, Russia was
required to make investments to offset the declining production
volume at existing gas fields, and was thus not in a position to
simply switch all its gas production to the East Asian markets.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

of energy by China have been climbing steeply in parallel with the
rapid growth in demand, and consequently the direction taken by
China’s energy policy will be an extremely decisive factor not only
for Chinese energy security, but also for the stability of the global
energy market. According to IEA estimates, Chinese energy demand will
increase by 60 percent by 2035 over the 2010 figure, accounting for
33 percent of the growth in total world energy demand. Especially
notable is the projected average annual growth of 2.2 percent in
China’s consumption of oil in volume terms, with daily consumption
rising from 9 million barrels per day in 2010, eclipsing that of the
United States by the late 2020s and reaching 15.1 million barrels per

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
Chinese government has long been aware of this problem, and has been
working to diversify its oil procurement sources. Meanwhile, it has
been attempting to restrain the growth in oil consumption while
maintaining a high economic growth rate through large-volume
consumption of domestically mined coal. In recent years, however, the
government has recognized the environmental consequences of
large-scale coal burning as a serious obstacle to continued economic
development. As a result, at the 12th session of the National
People’s Congress in March 2011, a policy was adopted to expand
consumption of the more environmentally friendly natural gas as an
alternative to both oil and coal. This was proclaimed as the basic
policy underlying the energy measures stipulated in the country’s
currently ongoing Twelfth Five-Year Guideline.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

raise the proportion of environmentally friendly primary energy, the
Chinese government has announced a policy of expanding the percentage
of energy accounted for by sources other than fossil fuels from the
8.3 percent figure of 2010 to 11.4 percent by 2015, and of doubling
the percentage of total energy usage accounted for by natural gas to
8.6 percent by 2015. The government aims to achieve this short-term
goal principally by expanding imports of natural gas, but as its goal
over the medium-to-long term, it plans to reduce China’s dependence
on imports through expanded domestic production of nonconventional
forms of gas including coalbed methane (CBM) as well as shale gas. In
this connection, the government has focused its attention on the
possibilities for taking advantage of the US shale revolution by
introducing US shale gas development and production technology into
China.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

Twelfth Five-Year Guideline (the term “guideline” has now
officially replaced the formerly used term “plan”) was approved
by the National People’s Congress in March 2011. Following this,
the National Energy Administration solicited the opinions of
interested parties, and after estimating the possibilities for
further advances in the shale revolution and for the acquisition of
the necessary technology by China, in January 2013 the government
published its Twelfth Five-Year Guideline for the energy industry.
Under this guideline, domestic production of natural gas is to be
increased from 110 billion cubic meters in 2012 to 156.5 billion
cubic meters in 2015. Of this increase, shale gas will account for
only 6.5 billion and CBM for 20 billion and the majority of the
growth will continue to come from conventional natural gas fields.
The Guideline emphasizes the importance of promoting development of
shale gas reserves such as in the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang in China’s
far west as well as in Changqing in Inner Mongolia, so as to
contribute to economic and social stability in those regions.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

other countries in this field. In December 2013, US Vice President
Joe Biden met with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing, and the two
reached agreement on strengthened cooperation in the energy field,
including shale gas development. At the end of October 2013, China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Royal Dutch Shell jointly
established a shale oil research center. While shale gas development
will continue within these collaborative frameworks, the Chinese have

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Regarding
energy development plans in China by individual companies,
PetroChina, the country’s largest such enterprise, plans to
increase production of natural gas (including shale gas) from the 80
billion cubic meters in 2012 to 150 billion cubic meters by 2020,
while China’s No. 2 company Sinopec plans to boost production from
3.7 billion in 2012 to a possible maximum of 10 billion by 2020. The
IEA forecasts that the scale of China’s domestic production of
natural gas will roughly triple between 2011 and 2035, from 103
billion to 320 billion cubic meters. Of this increase,
nonconventional gas—principally shale gas—is projected to account
for over 70 percent, reaching some 230 billion cubic meters by 2035.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">As
we have seen, the Chinese government is pursuing the production of
shale gas as a matter of national policy, but at the same time, a
number of issues need to be addressed. Firstly, on the technical
front, in contrast to the shale gas deposits in the United States,
those in China generally lie at greater depths, up to a maximum of
6,000 meters. Moreover, as they are located in mountainous areas or
deserts, the Chinese will not be able simply to apply existing US
technology to the development of these resources, and the necessary
infrastructure, including pipelines, has yet to be constructed.
Finally, as gas prices on the domestic market are strictly regulated,
the gas companies may not be able to sell their gas at prices that
will enable them to adequately recoup their development investments.
For these reasons, irrespective of the production plans put forward
by the enterprises involved, some observers expect the start of
full-scale production volume growth to be delayed to 2020 or beyond.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Meanwhile,
viewing the government-led development of the Chinese domestic
natural gas market as an attractive business opportunity, a number of
foreign companies are taking an aggressive approach to capital
participation. These expectations regarding the growth of the Chinese
natural gas market would facilitate the realization of China’s
energy imports policy. Up to now, the Chinese government has expended
considerable effort on the active pursuit of “resource diplomacy,”
so as to secure rights and interests overseas, but with the
increasing attractiveness of the natural gas market, China is
aggressively engaged in attracting investment in its domestic natural
gas market, principally from the countries of Central Asia as well as
Russia.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">This
conforms to China’s overriding interest in ensuring a reliable
supply of gas via pipelines and thereby reducing its vulnerability to
disruptions of LNG transportation by ship. For example, China began
importing natural gas from Turkmenistan in 2009, and in 2011 signed
an agreement to increase the import volume to 40 billion cubic
meters, thereby raising the volume from 3.5 billion in 2010 to 20
billion in 2012. This accounts for more than fifty percent of China’s
total imports. Then, in June 2012 a further contract was signed for a
maximum annual import volume of 60 billion cubic meters. With this,
Turkmenistan became China’s largest supplier of natural gas.
Imports of natural gas, albeit of only a small volume, began from
Uzbekistan in August 2012, and the government of Kazakhstan is also
considering plans to export to China.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Demand
for natural gas in the Chinese market is estimated to grow to 544
billion cubic meters by 2035, or five times the consumption in 2012.
The Chinese government plans to meet this demand through a
combination of domestic production and imports, but if global shale
gas production continues to increase steadily, the country should be
able to reduce its dependence on imports. In specific terms, in 2010
it was estimated that China’s dependence on imports would rise
steeply, to 53 percent by 2035, but in the 2012 estimates the
possibility emerged of this figure being revised downward to 41
percent. Additionally, import conditions are also moving in a
direction favorable to China. In view of these factors, while there
remain a number of issues to be addressed before the shale revolution
can exert an indirect impact on China; it will probably help improve
the country’s energy security situation and also make some
contribution toward stabilizing the global energy market.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">As
a first step, the insecurity of oil supply and the financial problems
that have arisen clearly call for a wide-ranging coordinated program
among all importing countries. This was the main reason why the
American government called for a conference of the major
oil-importing countries in February of this year. This cooperative
effort falls into two basic parts: first, what must be done
internally by the importing countries; and second, what a coordinated
policy should be vis-à-vis producing countries. With the
oil-producing countries already cooperating closely through OPEC,
cooperation among the oil-importing countries is a simple necessity;
properly understood and handled, it can be the only way to achieve
constructive overall adjustments.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Among
themselves, the importing countries must first establish and
coordinate their research and development programs with regard to
existing and new energy resources. Unnecessary and time-consuming
duplication must be avoided, and research and development efforts
should be concentrated on those resources where optimum results can
be expected. The skills available for research and the engineering
resources that would have to be employed, if not pooled, should at
least be utilized in accordance with a program for maximum overall
efficiency.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
oil-importing countries must also establish a concurrent and
consistent program of energy conservation which would provide for far
greater efficiency in the use of energy resources. Here too the
research effort and the measures to be taken should be coordinated on
an international basis.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Whatever
the course of foreign oil prices, policies to conserve consumption
and to spur the development of alternative energy sources will remain
relevant for the future. Moreover, a high degree of government
involvement is essential to the success of such efforts-including the
probable necessity of government guarantees putting a floor under the
selling price of alternative energy sources. For if-as we shall see
later-there is a chance that foreign oil prices will fall, then
private interests working on projects for tar sands, shale,
gasification of coal and the like, will not be willing or able to
continue their efforts. If a major effort to develop alternative
energy resources is to be sustained, particularly in North America,
the criterion cannot be orthodox economic soundness weighing the
price of alternative energy against the actual (or predicted) price
of foreign oil. Rather, the decisive criterion must be the price to
which foreign oil could and would rise if the alternative energy
supplies were not forthcoming. The public interest in avoiding
dependence on foreign oil dictates public support and a substantial
measure of price guarantees by individual countries, notably the
United States but perhaps others as well, again acting in
coordination.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Thirdly,
the major importing countries must be able to agree on a problem that
has so far eluded their efforts-that of adequate stockpiling and
burden-sharing. On stockpiling, no importing nation should now have
on hand perhaps less than a supply equal to six months of its
imports. And there must be clear contingency plans for restrained
consumption and for sharing, if oil supplies are again cut off or
curtailed-whether for political or economic reasons. Remaining oil
imports must be parceled out according to some formula based not on
the previous percentage of imports from the sources cut off, but on
the basis largely of need-so that those fortunate enough to possess
substantial national energy resources would have the smallest, if
any, claim on the oil still flowing. Beyond that, we do not believe
it would be politically feasible to establish rules that would
require countries able domestically just to cover their minimum
requirements to export some of their domestic energy supplies to a
less fortunate country.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

oil-importing countries must abstain from trying to resolve their
balance-of-trade problems by unduly pushing their general exports to
other oil-importing countries or by restricting their imports from
them. Such policies would only aggravate the problems of these other
countries. Competitive devaluation of currencies or inflation of
export prices would be self-defeating, since the oil-producing
countries clearly intend to adjust the level of oil prices in
accordance with an index of currency values as well as the cost of
manufactured goods and other commodities in world trade. The
oil-importing countries may have to act in many other ways in order
to avoid such dangerous repercussions as severe deflation and
unemployment. To deal with the situation will require an
unprecedented degree of self-restraint, prudent economic management
and political sophistication and wisdom. Past experience suggests
extreme skepticism that the countries will in fact consistently
follow such policies. But if they do not, the consequences for all of

discriminatory practices, or by transactions designed to tie up for
themselves an excessive part of the import capacity of the
oil-producing country. They must also resist the temptation to offset
their oil deficits by the competitive rearming of the various Middle
East countries, a practice bound in the end to produce a military
disaster for all.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

much for the minimum initial requirements for cooperation among the
major oil-importing countries. A measure of common appreciation does
now exist for most of these “headings of cooperation” by at least
a large majority of the relevant importing countries, although they
have yet to be fleshed out by practical working arrangements or
adequate guidelines for national behavior.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
hardest questions remain. Even if cooperation is achieved in all
these respects, can it serve to do more than shorten the period of
extreme vulnerability and cushion the impact of continued one-sided
decisions by the OPEC countries? Is consumer cooperation truly
adequate if it does not address itself to the key questions of price
and supply?</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">It
is believed the answer to both questions is in the negative. When the
brewing crisis came to a head last fall, the initial reaction of many
importing countries was to try unilaterally to take care of
themselves for both economic and strategic reasons-through barter
arrangements, major investment offers to various producing countries,
even in some cases extravagant arms supply deals. This tendency was
an understandable reaction in the first phase of the new crisis, and
indeed a continuing degree of individual national initiatives is not
only inevitable, but can be healthy in some respects, in providing an
infusion of economic and political alternatives into the changing
relationships between oil-importing and oil-producing countries.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Already,
however, the limits of the individual approach are obvious. Even for
the most aggressive of the oil-importing nations, it has not worked
effectively; they find themselves with very large obligations in
return for very small increments of favorable treatment, or for
nothing more concrete than a generalized promise for the future.
Moreover, where there have been specific deals, these are as much
subject to abrogation or revision as the basic arrangements
themselves. “What have you done for me lately?” is not a question
confined to the dialogue between politicians and voters.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Moreover,
precipitate attempts by individual countries to go it alone can only
obscure the nature of the problem, which is basically a common one
that engages not only the interests of all the importing countries
but the interests of the producers in a viable world economy and in
their own regional and national political stability. The producers
are bound not to see the problem in this light if one importing
country after another posits this arrangement or that as its own
selfish modus vivendi. And to defer attempts at resolution of the
common payments problem while individual initiatives are being
exhausted is bound to make eventual general agreement more difficult,
because so many inconsistent cards will have been played.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Thus,
a constructive accommodation between the interests of producers and
importers, enabling the latter to pay for and finance adequate oil
imports, is possible only if the importing countries share a common
appreciation of the need for a price adjustment as well as for the
establishment of financial mechanisms to this end. Just as
far-reaching cooperation among the producing countries has brought
about the present situation, so a similar cooperation among the
importing countries is now an essential prerequisite to a balanced
solution. Only if the major importing nations act to coordinate their
policy can they expect to be able to present the supply and financial
problems they are facing in an effective manner-and to make clear the
implications of these problems for the producers themselves.
Moreover, only then could they impress upon at least the relevant
producing countries what I believe are the two central elements in a
satisfactory long-term arrangement-some downward adjustment in the
level of foreign crude oil prices to all consumers, and specific
relief, including long-term deferment of payments, for the neediest
of the oil-importing countries.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
