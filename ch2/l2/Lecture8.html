<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
vast Central Asian plain is a region without many natural frontiers,
a geographic fact that has made Asia’s heartland historically the
site of power spillovers and territorial competition. Abutting this
region are China, Russia, Iran and Turkey, which in Goblet’s terms
are ‘extensive’ states – territorially large, exploitive of
human and physical resources and profligate in their use, and given
to territorial expansion as much as they expect it from others
(Goblet, 1955). Each of these four states feels deeply vulnerable in
relation to its Central Asian borders and regions. China’s two most
restive provinces, Tibet and Xinjiang, are also its western-most.
Beijing particularly worries about Pan-Turkic sentiment and Islamic
radicalism crossing its porous borders into Xinjiang and stoking
centripetal tendencies. Russia is concerned about the slow
depopulation of eastern Siberia and the growing Sinicisation of the
region. Eastern Siberia, like Xinjiang, contains significant fossil
fuel deposits. Iran and Turkey also worry about the porousness of
their borders to damaging transnational flows, from terrorism to
drugs. Both states are also worried about the irredentist urges of
minorities – particularly Kurds – on their territorial
peripheries. Given these vulnerabilities, the historical tendency has
been towards a ‘defensive expansionism’: Russia and China in
Central Asia; Russia, Turkey and Iran in the Caucasus; and India,
China and Pakistan on the Himalayan elevation. More recently, these
competitive urges, while still present, have been moderated by
co-operative ventures. Realizing their mutual vulnerabilities, and
the damage that could be done if they began stoking insurgencies in
each other’s territories, the Asian great powers have forged common
cause against separatism. Through mechanisms such as the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO), China and Russia have sought to
offset their territorial vulnerabilities. India, Pakistan and Iran
attended their first meeting of the SCO as observers in October 2005
(SCO n.d.).</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Energy
adds complexity to the dynamics of great power competition and
collaboration in Asia. Post-Soviet Central Asia has emerged as a
region with significant fossil fuel reserves as well as a possible
alternative to maritime transport routes between West Asia and East
and South Asia. The terrestrial order therefore offers an alternative
to the US-dominated international energy trade. Thus the other power
with an interest in the Central Asian order is the US. Realizing that
energy sourced and transiting through Central Asia has the potential
to erode its position as the sole supplier of global energy security,
Washington has established a significant presence in the region. Its
expanded diplomatic links were complemented after 9/11 by several
basing arrangements in Central Asia, developments which greatly
increased China’s, Iran’s and Russia’s geostrategic discomfort,
and led to renewed rivalry in the region.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
final element in a volatile mix in Central Asia is supplied by the
regimes of the post-Soviet Central Asian states. Most have emerged as
secular authoritarian governments, plagued by domestic instability
and territorial disputes, subject to great power (mainly Russian)
interference, and threatened by growing Islamist grassroots
movements. For those with significant oil gas reserves, these
resources simply exacerbate many of these problems, by heightening
territorial competition among states and increasing domestic
resentment over the inequitable distribution of oil and gas rents. In
many Central Asian states, the patterns and dilemmas are reminiscent
of those in West Asia: the choice between authoritarianism and
theocratic populism, the growing urgency felt by regimes to capture
oil and gas rents, and the increasing stakes of outside powers in the
domestic regime makeup of the states.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
resulting geopolitical competition is different from its maritime
counterpart. In the first place, while the US is a major player, it
is by no means the main influence on the Central Asian order. For
Washington, energy complements and draws together its other main
strategic interests in Central Asia: terrorism and proliferation
(Klare, 2005a). Its main objectives in Central Asia are to draw the
region’s regimes into the Western orbit, particularly in relation
to the energy trade and the War on Terror, to intensify Central
Asia’s economic links with Western Europe, to isolate Iran and to
curb Russian and Chinese influence (Myers-Jaffe &amp; Manning, 2001:
143). The US wants to lock in Central Asia’s energy supplies as an
integral part of a diversified single global energy market.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Most
of these goals put Washington in direct competition with Russia and
China. Moscow sees the region as part of its traditional sphere of
influence and is deeply opposed to interloping great powers. Energy
transfers and security assistance have been two of its main levers
for exercising influence over its ‘near abroad’. Russia has
several objectives in seeking to gain influence over Central Asia’s
energy exports. Russian nationalists cite the Soviet role in
developing oil and gas fields in Central Asia and the Caucasus, and
demand a cut for Russia of all subsequent production. More
dispassionately, Moscow has sought to influence the routing of
pipelines through its territory as a way of offsetting its own
vulnerabilities, as its western distribution of Russian energy
production runs through the territory of various US allies.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Central
Asia has increasingly been coordinated into a joint strategy for
limiting US influence through the Shanghai Co-operation Organization
(SCO), an organization linking Russia and China with Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. The SCO has developed its own
counter-terrorism training and joint exercises and has promoted
economic integration among its members – each component of which
seeks to counter a US objective. Moscow and Beijing are unambiguous
in their support for Central Asia’s authoritarian regimes in their
struggles against separatism and Islamist populism. This seems to
have provided an edge over the US, whose support for democratic
reform in the region left it vulnerable to a Sino–Russian campaign
seeking to dislodge US bases from Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan in
mid-2005. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

has been a notable beneficiary of Asia’s terrestrial geopolitics.
Its own substantial, US-embargoed energy reserves, plus its
geographic position as a potential strategic ‘hub’ linking
Central Asian energy fields with maritime distribution through the
Persian Gulf, have enhanced its strategic coin substantially.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Not
only have China and India negotiated major energy supply deals with
Tehran (with China by the end of 2004 becoming Iran’s largest
export market), but so have significant US allies such as Japan and
Turkey. In an era of rising oil prices and vanishing surplus
capacity, foreign companies are undeterred by the United States’
Iran–Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA) which threatens embargoes against
companies doing business with Iran; indeed, some have been willing to
challenge the WTO-compatibility of ILSA. Tehran seems to have been
successful in converting some of this strategic coin into diplomatic
coin, and can likely rely on a Chinese and possibly a Russian veto as
the issue of Iran’s nuclear program is debated in the UN Security
Council. Thus Iran, Washington’s major bete noir in West Asia, is
inarguably its strongest geopolitical situation in decades. The
invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the Syrian withdrawal from
Lebanon, have provided it with unprecedented regional leverage. Its
traditional Arab rivals, Ba’athist Iraq and Saudi Arabia, have
either been eclipsed or distracted by internal turmoil. Its growing
links to Russia, China and India are increasingly subverting
US-backed isolation, and Tehran now has a range of deterrents against
direct US attack either in hand or very close to hand: terrorism in
the Levant; order and disorder in Afghanistan and Iraq; and closing
in on a nuclear weapon.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
geopolitics of energy security in Asia presents a unique perspective
into some emerging trends in international relations. Influencing the
conditions of production and supply in Asia are central to the United
States’ global role, but these tasks are beset by major challenges.
The combination of rising oil prices, vanishing surplus capacity,
growing concerns over energy security, and competing US policy
commitments in West and Central Asia constitute major obstacles to
Washington’s objectives. While on the surface, the US-guaranteed
global energy market is working efficiently, underneath there are
signs that both US allies and rivals are hedging against the market
and the US-determined order in West Asia.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">One
commentator suggests that if present trends towards the competition
for equity oil continue, the United States itself may be forced
towards a more mercantilist approach to the security of supply. Faced
with these obstacles, the US may slowly lose its role as sole
guarantor of the world energy trade and its ability to determine the
regional order in West Asia.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">If
this is the implication of emerging trends in energy security in
Asia, it has major implications for regional and global security. An
Asia in which US policy is increasingly challenged and subverted by
emerging great powers would seem to portend a period of regional and
global instability. The vision summoned by Walter Russell Mead, of ‘a
world with half a dozen powers dueling for influence in the Middle
East, with each power possessing the will and the ability to
intervene with military force in this explosive region’, is an
extremely dangerous and pessimistic one. Yet this need not be the
only outcome of current geopolitical trends. One alternative, already
trialed in Central Asia, is that powers with partly competitive but
partly mutual interests will forge a cooperative arrangement for
managing the regional order. In order for this to happen, each of the
stakeholders will need to recognize the direction of the geopolitical
trends and respond rationally to the options they present.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
