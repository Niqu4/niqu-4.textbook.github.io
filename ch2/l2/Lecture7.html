foreign ministers of 27 EU member states in January this year in
response to Tehran’s refusal to dismantle its nuclear program
approved an embargo on oil supplies from Iran and freezing of any
transactions with the Iranian Central Bank. After the decision the
European companies are not eligible to enter into new contracts for
the supply of Iranian oil, and from July 1, its import into Europe
must be frozen. Iran, which insists that its nuclear program is aimed
solely at meeting the country's electricity needs, in response to the
EU has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz - the only sea route
allowing exporting Arab oil and gas to third countries, including the
United States. The share of oil logistics accounts for about 40% of
global oil exports by sea. Washington backed the EU sanctions and
called on other countries, particularly China, to join them. In order

has stopped selling crude oil in France and the UK. Europe consumes
only 20% of Iranian exports, like China, which is one of the major
buyers of Iranian “black gold”, which are Japan, India and South
Korea. To further put pressure on Tehran, Washington and Brussels
have repeatedly attempted to win over Beijing on their side of the

cut oil supplies from Iran by 54% (compared with the previous year)
