<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
the traditional regions of great-power rivalry—the Middle East and
Central Asia—the abundance of oil and gas reserves led to
competition between states over access to these resources and also,
as in the case of the landlocked Caspian Sea basin, over pipeline
routes. Both local and outside powers may maintain a military
presence in order to protect drilling rigs, pipelines, refineries and
other oil and gas facilities, as well as to ensure the stability of
producing or transit regions. Usually, foreign troops are stationed
with the clear aim of protecting the flow of oil and gas—typical
examples are the different types of US presence in Colombia and the
Persian Gulf region. Sometimes, a wider military campaign—like
Russia’s in Chechnya or the USA’s in Iraq—is also seen by many
observers as having an energy component because, even if it has other
prima facie motives, it takes place in an area of great significance
for regional and (in the case of Iraq) global energy security.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
2003 US-led invasion of Iraq aimed to create a new, Western-friendly
Iraq as the first building block of a more democratic and stable
Middle East that would, among other things, ensure Western access to
the region’s energy resources. Paradoxically, the operation and
post-war US military presence in Iraq have not only failed to
stabilize the region or to increase the security of oil supplies, but
have also opened the door to new threats. Today, the increasing
terrorist activity in the Middle East includes frequent attacks on
oil facilities in Iraq, yet there are many other tempting oil-related
targets for terrorists in the region. The Strait of Hormuz is the
world’s most important oil chokepoint, with 17 million barrels (2.3
million tonnes) of oil passing through it each day, about 20 percent
of the global supply. Just one supertanker on fire in the narrow
strait could block the passage for other shipping and seriously
disrupt supplies to the global oil market for weeks.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Another,
and perhaps the most disturbing, factor that may shape the future
security dynamics of the region is the continuing expansion of Iran’s
influence. Iran could at any moment try to block the Strait of
Hormuz. More generally, the Persian Gulf abounds in major unresolved
territorial disputes between its states, for example between Iran and
the UAE, between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and between Qatar and
Bahrain. All these factors and more—including developments
involving Israel—could destabilize the Middle East political scene
and thus threaten oil supplies. This makes them also a potential
source of armed conflict or military intervention.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Fierce
territorial disputes over oil and gas deposits occur also in other
geostrategically important regions, primarily Central Asia and the
South China Sea. Relative to the South China Sea, disputes in Central
Asia between Caspian Sea littoral states have a more peaceful and
diplomatic character and are only one aspect of a wider international
rivalry that started after the Soviet Union’s collapse and the
opening up of the region’s oil and gas fields to Western companies.
The key issues include access to Caspian Sea energy resources for
foreign companies, and rival pipeline schemes to ensure (for each
particular state) the most profitable route for exports to world
markets. The construction of new export facilities, especially
large-diameter pipelines, to transport increasing volumes of Caspian
oil and gas to world markets has become the most important field of
international competition in the region. However, other geopolitical
interests are also at stake in the local rivalry between China, Iran,
Russia, the USA and other powers. Future threats to security in
Central Asia are, on balance, more likely to flow from ethnic
conflicts, separatist movements and unstable political regimes and
economic systems than from a ‘great game’ of competition over oil
and gas transport routes.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
the South China Sea, prolonged international quarrels and disputes
over the boundaries of exclusive economic zones and the ownership of
islands seem to be the main destabilizing factors in the region,
which is not only believed to hold substantial oil and gas deposits
but is also the chief route for seaborne oil and gas supplies to
Asian countries. Tensions and military activity date back to the
1970s, around the time of China’s 1974 invasion of the Paracel
Islands. Soon after the discovery of large oil deposits in the
Spratly Islands in 1976, several littoral countries began production
there. Territorial disputes over the Spratly Islands have involved
six states: Brunei Darussalam, China, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Taiwan and Viet Nam. All have built up their military presence in the
region, so that today up to 65 islets, reefs and rocks in the South
China Sea are occupied by military troops from various countries.
Since the late 1980s there have been recurrent naval clashes in the
South China Sea. In its 1992 Law on the Territorial Sea and the
Contiguous Zone, China claimed sovereignty over the whole Spratly and
Paracel archipelagos and authorized it to use force in the event of
any attempt at occupation by another country. These and other ongoing
disputes—China and Viet Nam are locked in a similar dispute over
the Gulf of Tonkin, Malaysia and the Philippines over the areas east
of Borneo, and Malaysia and Viet Nam over the maritime boundary in
the Gulf of Thailand—destabilize the situation in South-East Asia
and could indirectly threaten the energy security of other Asian
states, like Japan or South Korea. Although China has often been seen
as the prime mover in regional conflicts, in more recent years the
Chinese Government has shown some tendency to try to resolve
territorial problems through more diplomatic measures. A telling
example is the 2002 code of conduct in the South China Sea, the first
political document concluded between China and the Association of
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) over the disputed region. The code
of conduct stresses the need for peaceful settlement of territorial
and jurisdictional disputes in the region and obliges the parties to
avoid any activity that could ‘complicate or escalate disputes and
affect peace and stability’, including action to inhabit currently
uninhabited islands and other features.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">An
equally problematic issue in the South China Sea is control over its
energy arteries, particularly the sea lanes from the Persian Gulf
region and the approaches to the Strait of Malacca, through which
11.7 million barrels (1.6 million tonnes) of oil and two-thirds of
global LNG deliveries pass daily, bound for China, Japan, South Korea
and other Pacific Rim countries. China, India, the USA and some other
states feel entitled to use their own military sources to protect
these sea lanes against piracy or terrorist attacks and ensure free
passage for their ships and tankers, yet they are also suspicious of
each other. India and Japan see Chinese naval expansion as a bid for
dominance in the region and a threat to their own security. For the
USA, China’s leading military position in the South China Sea
appears to challenge its own military role in the Western Pacific, as
well as threatening Taiwan. At the same time, China regards US plans
for military presence in the Strait of Malacca as a threat to its
national interests in the South China Sea, while Indonesia and
Malaysia also reject the idea of US patrols in the strait.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
strategic engagements of the USA in the Persian Gulf, China in the
South China Sea and Russia in Central Asia underline that these are
the primary potential zones of interstate rivalry in the energy
context. Within this ‘strategic triangle’ the world’s largest
oil and natural gas deposits are to be found, national frontiers have
for years been disputed and the security interests of various states
collide. Even so, for the most part it is rather difficult to imagine
that these rivalries could turn into armed conflict—too many states
have too much to lose. Armed conflict with an energy resource
dimension is in practice more likely to take place outside the
strategic triangle, particularly in Africa.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
structural conditions of many African countries—authoritarian
governments, weak and corrupt political elites, poverty and economic
inequality within societies, the unbalanced distribution of revenues
from energy resources, and so on—make them prone to internal armed
conflicts that have a resource dimension. The pillaging of energy
resources is often a factor that prolongs an armed conflict even if
it was triggered by other reasons. In Angola, oil revenues—which
account for 90 percent of government income—fuelled arms purchases
during the 1974–2002 civil wars; oil money has been an increasingly
important issue in the ongoing conflicts in Sudan, at first in the
south of the country and currently in Darfur. It is telling that
during these civil conflicts oil companies from Canada, China,
France, Kuwait, Malaysia, Russia, Sweden and the USA among others
have bought oil concessions and begun to develop oil facilities in
Sudan. Today, the situation in Nigeria is also evolving towards
increased volatility and conflict. Instead of giving the country a
chance to be one of the wealthiest in Africa, oil has enriched a tiny
minority of Nigerians and led to environmental and health problems as
well as impoverishing the oil-producing regions’ inhabitants. This
finally led to open conflict in the Niger Delta region.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">As
the problems of oil have become matters that in many key respects can
only be handled directly between governments, so their gravity has
now become all too clear. Faced with the major “supply shock” of
the October 1973 oil embargo and the overall cutback in Arab oil
production, the immediate reaction of practically every importing
country was to engage in a competitive scramble for oil supplies,
coupled with offers to adapt its Middle East policy to Arab demands,
and promises of all kinds of financial inducements. It was indeed a
humiliating experience for historically independent and proud
nations. What we were witnessing, in fact, was not only the
fragmentation of the operations of the multinational oil companies,
but also the polarization of the oil policies of the importing
countries, with foreign petroleum ministers skillfully influencing
individual importing countries through the device of handing out oil
rewards and punishments.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Then,
late in 1973, the advance in world oil prices dictated by OPEC
countries was of such magnitude that practically every importing
nation was suddenly confronted with major balance-of-trade problems
of immediate and continuing effect. The cost of foreign oil supplies
for all importing countries will exceed $100 billion in 1974,
compared with some $20 billion in 1972. For developing countries
alone, it will jump from $5 billion in 1973 to $15 billion in
1974-and the $10-billion increase will exceed all the foreign aid
that these countries received in the previous year. Meanwhile, as
noted, the OPEC producing countries will accumulate, during 1974
alone, surplus holdings of foreign exchange not needed for their own
import requirements of some $60 billion-or nearly two-thirds of the
net book value of total U.S. private foreign investment.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Obviously,
this surplus accumulation of funds will somehow be recycled into the
world's monetary system initially, probably mainly into the
short-term Eurodollar market. But this process will not necessarily
result in the availability of loans to the various importing
countries in accordance with their individual foreign exchange needs.
The creditworthiness of the borrower will decide whether or not
Eurodollar loans will be available; many of the developing countries
and some developed countries will not qualify under this criterion.
Foreign grants and soft loans-some of them probably never to be
repaid-will have to be made available, and the Monetary Fund and the
World Bank are addressing themselves to this problem. We doubt that
anything like adequate amounts can be made available.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">But
the financial oil drainage is not only a short-term and passing
issue. It will be with us for many, many years-if oil prices remain
at present levels (or rise as is now occasionally threatened), and if
the oil-producing countries themselves are not prepared to make
favorable loan arrangements to needy countries in addition to
whatever the developed countries are able and willing to do. To the
extent that oil imports are financed by a continued recycling of
surplus oil revenues via investments or loans on commercial terms,
oil-importing countries will face pyramiding interest or individual
charges on top of mounting direct oil import costs.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Equally
if not more disturbing is the question whether or not the producing
countries owning already large surplus funds will be willing to
continue to maintain or to expand their production and accumulate
financial holdings that might result, in part at least, in nothing
but paper claims that could not be repaid. If the producing countries
make direct foreign investments, the bulk of such investments will
obviously be placed in the advanced developed countries, where it
would appear to be safest and most profitable. That will leave the
less-preferred developed countries and the developing countries out
in the cold. Moreover, the scope for such investments owned directly
by foreign producing governments is likely to be limited.
Accordingly, oil-exporting countries with surplus revenues might well
decide to reduce production-to conserve their liquid gold in the
ground rather than increase potential paper claims above ground. Oil
revenue surpluses could thus well conduce to oil supply shortage.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">There
are thus valid reasons to fear that even where present policies of
producing countries provide for expanding oil production,
circumstances might arise where, in what they consider to be their
own self-interest or even for any political whim, the governments
involved abruptly cut their level of oil exports. Kuwait, Libya, Abu
Dhabi, Ecuador, and Venezuela have already announced restrictions in
their production. Iran has threatened to do so if the importers
object to price levels.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
financial dilemma for oil-importing countries is clear. In order to
finance oil import costs, they will have to look to progressively
expanded foreign investment by, or indebtedness to, producing
countries. Without any amelioration in the cartel prices and payments
terms, the alternative for importing countries would be rather severe
reductions in oil imports and oil consumption. To cut back imports
drastically, to levels that could be financed out of current income,
would hardly be a viable solution. The resulting shortfall in total
energy, and the economic consequences of declines in production,
employment and trade, would further undercut the oil-importing
countries’ ability to finance even sharply reduced levels of oil
supplies. The contraction of energy consumption and economic activity
would thus become a cumulative spiral.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
sum, the short- to medium-term implications of the present situation
are simply not bearable, either for the oil-importing
countries-especially the nations already needy-or for the world
economy as a whole. In the wake of this topsy-turvy winter, with the
Arab oil embargo against the United States now lifted, the temptation
is momentarily strong to suppose that the oil crisis has now
genuinely eased. The major industrialized countries of the world once
again look forward to economic growth, though at lower rates, with
worldwide balance-of-payments deficits, and with a terrible economic
and political problem of inflation, to which oil prices have made a
substantial contribution. But the oil balance-of-payments burden is
just starting and the transfer of funds to oil-producing countries
just beginning. In any case, no significant lasting relief at all is
in sight for the needy oil-importing countries. The fact is that the
world economy-for the sake of everyone-cannot survive in a healthy or
remotely healthy condition if cartel pricing and actual or threatened
supply restraints of oil continue on the trends marked out by the new
situation.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
