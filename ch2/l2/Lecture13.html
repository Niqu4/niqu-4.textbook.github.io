<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">As
stressed above, the rapidly rising demand for energy has led to more
competition in the world energy market. At the same time, both
consumer and producer countries have become more aware lately of the
many new challenges and threats to their energy security in the near
future. The complexity of these problems requires all states to
develop equally sophisticated energy policies on two fronts—internal
and external. The internal dimension of energy security policy
focuses primarily on such issues as (a) the choice of energy sources,
which should include diversifying and optimizing the national energy
structure as well as promoting environmental protection; (b) the
security of state energy infrastructure—energy grids, refineries,
pipelines, power stations and so on; (c) energy demand management;
(d) energy efficiency; and (e) liberalization and deregulation of the
energy sector. The development and promotion of alternatives to
fossil fuel energy sources—renewable sources and nuclear energy—can
play an important role in this dimension of energy policy. External
energy policy is more about the security of import supplies, access
to oil and gas fields, diversification among foreign suppliers, and
the variety and safety of transport routes. International cooperation
with exporters and transit countries, and with other importers, can
make an important contribution to this policy. Yet, as discussed
above, countries may also use less peaceful means to secure their
interests in the energy sphere—armed force, sanctions, embargoes or
the manipulation of energy as a weapon.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">For
all countries, energy resources represent more than just traded
commodities. They are strategic goods par excellence. Accordingly,
states’ decisions on almost every dimension of both internal and
external energy policy are based not just on economic, but in a large
measure also on geopolitical and security calculations. For instance,
European countries’ decisions in the 1970s to begin oil production
in the North Sea—one of the costliest regions in the world for
drilling—and Russia’s recent, very costly and technologically
advanced oil and gas pipeline developments (such as the Blue Stream
and Nord Stream gas pipelines) were dictated above all by security
and geopolitical calculations.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Today
it is clear that some aspects of energy security, which has
traditionally been regarded as a purely national or internal matter,
are best addressed collectively on a multilateral basis. The reason
is that one country’s energy policy choices may have significant
impacts on other countries’ choices. Rising demand in one
region—often as an effect of low energy efficiency and weak,
demand-oriented policies—aggravates international competition over
access to energy resources and to the supply system. If producers
adopt a nationalistic policy and close their energy sector to foreign
direct investments, they are in effect reducing their chances of
developing new exploration programs, production and transport
capabilities in the region. In the long term this will also prejudice
the supply situation in the world energy market. Finally, problems
such as high carbon dioxide emissions generated by the energy sector,
old, unsafe nuclear plants, and the transport and storage of
radioactive waste materials, even if they are treated as national
policy matters, generate risks and dangers that have a transnational
character and are of concern to the whole international community.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Nevertheless,
countries’ readings of the energy security concept often lead them
to make policy choices that disregard the energy interests and needs
of other market players. Robert Skinner notes that ‘Energy
security’s banality is due in large measure to its having been so
leveraged as a pretext for all manner of policy, from imperialism to
isolationism, from expansionism to protectionism, from communism to
economic liberalism’. In effect, countries’ approaches to energy
security range from the extremely self-centered and nationalistic to
the consistently cooperative. The former approach is more or less
characteristic of some of the major energy importers and exporters
like China, India, Iran, Russia, Venezuela and the USA, while most
European countries represent the latter approach. Naturally, in some
fields of energy security and in certain circumstances, countries
categorized as having a nationalistic vision of energy policy can
also act cooperatively. The USA was the initiator of the 1974
Washington conference that established the International Energy
Agency, and US strategic reserves are one of the key elements of the
present global energy security system. Russia is an active
participant in the Energy Charter Conference and Transit Protocol
negotiations. It also maintains an energy dialogue with the EU and
initiates international debates on energy security matters, as at the
July 2006 St Petersburg Summit of the Group of Eight industrialized
nations (G8). At the same time, these countries consciously avoid
legally binding international agreements—Russia has not ratified
the Energy Charter Treaty nor the USA the Kyoto Protocol. On the
other side, a rise in protectionism and nationalism in energy policy
can be observed in some European countries. France and Spain
intervened in 2006 in cross-border takeovers of their national energy
companies in a way that brought both countries into conflict with the
European Commission. These are not isolated incidents, since many
other EU members have not opened their national energy sectors to
foreign competition.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">A
nationalistic approach to energy policy in countries with more or
less autocratic regimes such as China, Iran, Russia or Venezuela is
simply a continuation of their wider economic policy course. Placing
national economic and strategic interests first, they want to
participate in the world economic system but on their own terms. The
USA, for its part, acts as a superpower in all security-related
spheres, including energy. Symptoms of the nationalistic approach
generally include a readiness to resort to the extreme instrument of
a military presence or use of force to secure national interests in
the regions abundant in energy resources—for example, China’s
behaviour in the South China Sea or the USA’s armed interventions
and military presence in the Middle East, as discussed above. A
nationalistic energy policy also manifests itself, however, in
economic terms through producers’ determination to keep the profits
of oil and gas production and the large cash flows generated by the
oil and gas companies within their own countries. Such governments
accordingly maintain strong state control over the energy sector,
including seeking to control foreign investment activity and, if
necessary, blocking all access by foreign investors to the energy
sector or using them only when they serve the national interest. The
most radical option is the nationalization of the energy sector. Some
spectacular examples of such a policy have occurred recently in
several producing countries. In May 2006 Bolivia nationalized its
natural gas sector and increased taxes on foreign energy companies.
In Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the independent owner of the Yukos
oil corporation, was prosecuted and dispossessed; the oil company
Sibneft was bought in October 2005 by Gazprom; and changes have been
made in the law providing access to licenses and oil export taxes
have been increased—these last both complicating the situation of
foreign investors. In Venezuela the government has taken steps to
enhance its control by reducing the autonomy of Petróleos de
Venezuela SA (PDVSA), increasing the royalties paid by private
companies under the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law, and changing the structure
of the oil industry—converting operating service agreements with
foreign companies into joint ventures with PDVSA, which is in turn
changing the nature of foreign participation in the country’s
energy sector.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">A
nationalistic policy by energy producers leads inevitably to tensions
with consumer countries, as seen in the traditionally close but now
strained US–Venezuelan relations. It also raises concerns over
future global energy security, since—as noted above—such a policy
tends to discourage foreign companies from investing in exploration
and production, with negative effects on future supplies. It can also
happen, however, that such methods help to strengthen cooperation and
a common front among consumer countries. Russia’s action in January
2006 to interrupt gas supplies to Ukraine has renewed fears of the
use of energy as a weapon in Europe and directly prompted the most
intensive and comprehensive discussion yet on a common EU energy
policy. In a Green Paper presented two months after the gas crisis,
the European Commission urged that the fragmented approach to energy
be abandoned and a common policy on both internal and external
aspects be developed. Such a policy could enable the 25 member
countries to speak with one voice on energy security-related issues
in global and other international forums, and give the EU greater
clout in negotiations with key energy suppliers. Nonetheless,
producers may also play consumer countries against each other—Russia
might refuse a compromise to EU negotiators in the framework of
collective dialogue and yet strike bargains with particular member
states on the same key energy issues in bilateral relations. In
effect, Germany has been strengthening its energy links with Russia
and protecting its own national interest, regardless of the other EU
members’ energy (or general security) concerns.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Taking
into account the present tight oil market and consumers’ concerns
over supply security, the nationalistic energy policy maintained by
major energy importers may have more serious geopolitical
implications. China’s increasing demand for energy made it a net
oil importer in 1993. Since then its external energy strategy has
been aimed at diversifying oil supplies through investments. The
China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) is buying licenses for
oil and gas production across the world, from the Asia–Pacific
region through the Middle East and Africa to South America; taking
over foreign oil companies; and looking for pipeline solutions for
transporting energy resources from Russia and Central Asia. India,
the world’s second fastest growing economy, has been developing a
similar strategy in recent years. The quests of both countries for
energy and for a larger investment stake bring them closer to each
other, yet at the same time exacerbate the energy security concerns
of other major importers.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">China
has clashed with Japan and the USA over energy issues several times.
As well as their disputes over oil and gas resources in the East
China Sea, China and Japan have competed in particular to host the
pipeline route from Russia’s East Siberia oil fields and for a
stake in oil and gas production on the island of Sakhalin. The USA
for its part sees China’s energy strategy as creating new economic
and strategic challenges that alter the whole geopolitical scene.
China has not only been investing its capital in all major world
producing regions but also attempted to purchase one of the largest
US oil companies, Unocal, and has been cultivating good relations
with producers, like Venezuela, that have recently been on bad terms
with the USA. The CNPC is investing in oil drillings in Sudan while
the USA has imposed sanctions on that country, including a
prohibition on US citizens and companies investing there. Although
the USA’s own policies can be seen as driven by national interest,
US Government analysts make a clear distinction between these
policies and those of China: ‘Whereas the United States has shifted
from an oil import strategy that was based upon controlling the oil
at its source to one that is based on global market supply and
pricing, the Chinese strategy is still focused on owning the import
oil at the production point.’</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Individual
market players will always have divergent energy interests and will
compete with each other in the energy market. Nevertheless, they also
have many common or parallel objectives—reducing the vulnerability
of the market and of their own economy to disruption, ensuring the
physical security of energy infrastructure and the safety of supply
routes, enhancing political and economic stability in producing
regions, and constructing a transparent legal framework for
investment. These issues should become fields for wider cooperation
involving both consuming and producing countries. Some attempts at
such cooperation have already been made at the regional level. For
instance, in the framework of the EU–Russia Energy Dialogue,
launched in October 2000, both sides have initiated cooperation on
the safety of energy transport networks; and in Asia in 2004 China
proposed the launch of an energy cooperation initiative and the
creation of a common Asian energy policy designed specially to
prevent terrorism and piracy against shipping in the Strait of
Malacca. It is worth noting that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has embarked on a study of how to promote energy
security.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Another
factor that could play a significant role in enhancing links and
interdependencies between states is their shared need for advanced,
appropriate and affordable technologies. An energy strategy needs to
be multifaceted: it should diversify supplies, diversify energy mix
(e.g. through enhancing the use of renewables or nuclear energy),
conserve energy resources by increasing fuel efficiency, maximize
indigenous domestic production and open the way for the use of
next-generation energy sources. Advanced energy technologies and
large-scale investments are necessary to achieve most of these goals,
and technological cooperation between states can give them the best
chance of securing their future energy needs in a cost-effective way.
The outstanding example in the field of next-generation technologies
is the cooperation between the EU and the USA: the 2003 Fuel Cell
Amendment to the 2001 Non-Nuclear Energy Cooperation Agreement
enables the two sides to conduct joint research on the use of
hydrogen as an alternative fuel source. One of the few tangible
achievements thus far of the EU–Russia Energy Dialogue has been in
precisely the field of technology cooperation. Since 2002 both sides
have been developing cooperation in the sphere of advanced energy
technologies through the EU–Russia Energy Dialogue Technology
Centre, based in Moscow. A more controversial recent example is the
Indian–US Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative, launched in 2005,
which gives India access to US civil nuclear technology.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

cooperation among oil-importing countries is essential to the
development of constructive cooperation with producing countries, so
too is a full and fair understanding by the importers of the case of
the producing countries. Many of its key points were presented
vividly in last July's issue of Foreign Affairs by Jahangir Amuzegar
of Iran; these points and others have since been developed in a
series of public statements by various leaders of producing
countries. Nonetheless it helps to go over the main elements that

what their long-term interests are.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">A
major goal of producing countries is rapid and consistent progress in
their economic development so that they can become economically
viable and secure by the time their oil reserves peter out. In the
meantime, the pace of their industrial progress depends largely on
the size of their oil revenues, and the level of oil prices is of
decisive importance for their present and future prosperity.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
producing countries also cite additional reasons to justify the huge
price increases that they imposed in the course of 1973. The large
increase in oil prices, they say, is warranted by the alternative
cost that would have to be incurred if oil had to be replaced by
other energy sources such as shale oil, oil from tar sands, etc. Even
though there is currently still a surplus of potential oil supplies,
oil reserves may well be exhausted in perhaps 20 to 30 years. But in
a free competitive market, prices would not, at this time, reflect
future shortages of supply and would thus provide no encouragement
for the development of substitutes. Accordingly, the oil-producing
countries say that high oil prices are now necessary so that research
and development programs for new energy sources will be promptly
initiated. Otherwise, with the long lead time required, energy would
be in short supply when world oil production begins to decline.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Also,
so they argue, high oil prices now will result in oil conservation
and encourage the use of oil for the most essential and valuable
purposes where it cannot be so easily replaced, such as for
petrochemical production. The highest-value use, they maintain,
should in practice be the basis for oil pricing.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
producing countries also assert that the high current oil prices
redress the injustice of too low a level of prices in the past, when
oil prices had fallen behind those of manufactured goods and food
which the oil-producing countries had to import. Relatively low oil
prices in the past have, they maintain, unduly enriched the developed
countries at their expense. (Whatever the degree of validity of this
argument for past periods, it should be noted that the increase in
oil prices between 1970 and January 1974 has, according to a United
Nations analysis, amounted to 480 percent and was extraordinarily
larger than that of practically any other commodity. The share of
petroleum in world imports of about $316 billion during 1970-the last
year for which detailed statistics are available-amounted to about
7.7 percent; at January 1974 commodity prices, the value of 1970
imports would have increased to $618 billion, of which petroleum
would have accounted for as much as 23 percent.)</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

countries are aware that high oil prices may harm the progress of
other developing countries. But primary responsibility for economic
assistance, so they postulate, rests on the rich developed countries.
And even though oil-producing countries maintain that in development
terms they are still poor, they have stated that they, too, will make
a substantial contribution to support developing countries, and a
number of them have indeed done so. In addition, they will endeavor
to convince other raw-material-producing developing countries that
they, too, could improve their economic position substantially if
they would only follow the OPEC example.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

producing countries also complain that in the past they have been
deprived of economic development based on their oil resources, such
as refineries, petrochemical plants, tankers, and energy-intensive
industries. Instead, enormous quantities of gas have been flared.
Accordingly, it is a basic part of their development policy that
investment in local petroleum-processing plants should be undertaken
on a large scale within the oil-producing countries, and that they
should participate far more in the whole operation of the
transportation and exporting of oil.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

there is substantial merit in many of the points now so forcefully
advanced by the oil-producing countries-and it is no effective answer

be basic unity among importing countries about the underlying

sensitive relationship between consuming and producing countries, a
contrary position of one or two major importing countries would tend
to destroy the effectiveness of this approach. It would also further
strengthen the producing countries in the sense of power that they

to assert themselves because of the disunity among, and unwillingness
of, importing countries to take any firm position vis-à-vis the
producing nations. Whatever the concern of producing countries and
companies in the pivotal transition from surplus producing capacity
to tightness of world oil supplies, the oil-importing countries were
largely complaisant about the course of events. Now, unrestrained
exercise of their oil and money power by producing countries
presupposes that the importing countries will continue to acquiesce
and remain passive, even if the world’s economic and political

the growth of indigenous energy sources-that have made the oil of the
OPEC countries, especially in the Middle East, so vital to
practically every nation of the world, and have thus given the OPEC
countries the bargaining leverage to establish the present

be placed in an intolerable state of dependence on Middle East oil if
it did not develop other sources of energy to the maximum and at the

4.5 percent to a suggested three percent. Essentially the same
analysis must now be applied to the oil-importing nations as a whole,
not for the sake of eliminating a critical degree of dependence on

major oil-consuming countries. Yet it remains as clear as it was a
year ago that no drastic technological breakthrough is in sight at
least in this time frame. We are still talking about natural gas,
coal, hydroelectric power and nuclear fission as the primary
alternatives to oil-and one need hardly add that even substantial
increases in some of these are still fraught with difficulty.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

response to the new situation, it is already reasonable to postulate
some conservation at the margin in response to higher energy costs.
Given the dynamic energy needs of Japan, the developing countries,
and to a lesser extent Western Europe, however, it is difficult to
see that “conservation at the margin” will in itself produce a
dramatic drop in the growth of energy needs.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
