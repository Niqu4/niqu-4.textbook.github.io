<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">For
the most part, the genesis and evolution of international law
suggests it to be a creature of consent between hegemonic States and,
in the final analysis, to reflect the balance of their interests. The
international community is merely a totality of disparate actors in
that sovereign States have distinct interests and disparate levels of
economic strength. Inter-State cooperation takes place to the extent
that the interests of the most influential States sufficiently
coincide. On certain aspects of the global energy economy – namely
in relation to its trade aspects – there is sufficient agreement of
interests that has resulted in degrees of global governance; on
others, there is not. For instance, the exploration, extraction,
production and allocation of energy resources currently take place on
a very different footing to that of addressing global energy
security. Namely, it takes place to the extent that it is profitable
to the actors at the various stages of energy exploration and
exploitation. In an increasingly more globalized economy in which, to
paraphrase Henry Kissinger, sovereign states consider their national
interests over their ad-hoc alliances, it is perhaps naïve to
currently expect there to be sufficient political will to set up a
global energy security governance regime. Or rather, it is perhaps
naïve to consider that the international community is composed of
States that are economically equal or whose interests are
sufficiently aligned to make such a global governance regime likely.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Starting
from a universal perspective, it becomes clear that there is no
unitary, cohesive and comprehensive universal regime exclusively set
up to address global energy security. One may view the UN Charter,
and the organization it  has  set  up,  as  providing  some  loose
top-level global governance that has incidental implications for the
global economy, including for the global energy economy. For
instance, it contains a normative framework with which inter-State
relations ought to comply. It effectively prohibits international
acts of aggression and preserves sovereign prerogatives over domestic
matters, including the management of natural resources and especially
of energy-related resources. Other than this, arguably, there is
neither a universal regime nor norms that could be said to be truly
universal or that may be universally espoused. This is particularly
the case in relation to the position under general international law
relating to the protection of investor interests.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Whilst
one witness’s instances of inter-State cooperation on energy
security, these are evidently not global. For instance, although the
regime under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) – principally
concerned with promoting trade and investment interests in the
energy/extractive industries of its Members–may, at best, promotes
the energy security of its membership, it is not of universal scope.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Given
the enormity of the subject in scope, it would be reasonable to
assume that there is a high degree of international cooperation
around the governance of energy.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
reality, global energy governance – if indeed such a thing exists -
is fragmented along thematic lines, and is normatively patchy at
that. This is unsurprising given the realities of international
cooperation. International cooperation does not occur on a
disinterested basis; it occurs to the extent that it draws in the
most influential States relevant to the matter in hand, and,
conceivably, when their respective interests are sufficiently
accommodated.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">States’
activities aimed at ensuring energy security are an important element
in their foreign policy and foreign relations. However, many features
of the international environment—the stability of producing
regions, market supply and demand and price trends, the state of
consumer–producer relations, consciousness of potential challenges
and threats to energy security, and so on—influence national energy
strategies and lead states to adopt different policies and use
different tools at different times. Countries’ efforts to assure
access to natural resources affect security dynamics particularly in
those parts of the world that are crucial for global energy security,
and may lead both to regional alliances and to conflicts between
major energy-consuming and energy producing countries. Thus,
contemporary structural changes in the energy market have serious
geopolitical implications.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">When
considering the role of energy security concerns in generating
tension or even conflict between states, it is important to emphasize
that most states would regard actual armed conflict as an extreme
measure for the purpose. Indeed, energy codependency between states,
like other factors of interdependence, may help to reduce the
likelihood of military conflict between them. The distinction should
be kept clear between, on the one hand, an increase in tension
between major energy market players that leads to rivalry rather than
direct armed confrontation, and on the other, actual conflict over
energy and other occurrences of the use of force in regions abundant
in oil and gas.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Competition
for resources is not new or characteristic of our times. Together
with competition for territory, it lies at the root of most violent
conflicts in history. The thesis of an increasing number of conflicts
over energy resource has become popular lately, yet analysts were
forecasting this trend more than three decades ago. For instance,
Richard Ullman in the early 1980s noticed a drop in the incidences of
conflict over territory and predicted that ‘as demand for some
essential commodities increases and supplies appear more precarious’,
more conflicts over resources, oil in particular, would arise. He
prophesied that such struggles ‘will often take the form of overt
military confrontations whose violent phases will more likely be
short, sharp shocks rather than protracted wars’, and that they
would occur between neighboring states above all.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.39in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Indeed,
the militarization of energy policy—that is, employing military
means to guarantee stability in oil- and gas-producing regions—has
been a phenomenon in international affairs for some time. A striking
example from 1980 is the Carter Doctrine in which, responding to the
1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, US President Jimmy Carter stated
that the USA would use ‘any means necessary’, including military
force, to defend its vital interests in the Persian Gulf, including
the flow of oil. Since the end of World War II, one of the
fundamental guarantees of secure oil supplies from the Middle East to
the world market—in times of peace and of war—has been the
combination of US policies designed to bolster the Saudi Arabian
monarchy. This commitment, dating back to the meeting of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt and King Ibn Saud in February 1945, has
involved direct US military engagement in the region, for instance
during the 1980–1988 Iraq–Iran War or after Iraq’s 1990
invasion of Kuwait.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
a typical ‘resource conflict’, the energy factor predominates.
However, there are also conflicts in which energy resources are just
one of many elements or catalysts. There are, thus, three basic ways
in which energy resources and armed conflicts interconnect. The first
and most obvious is when energy resources are the proximate cause of
a conflict; the second is when they play the role of an instrument,
target or any other secondary element of war; and the third is when
profits from the sale of energy resources help to finance armed
conflicts.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
