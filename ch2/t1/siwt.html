of the most important components of state power at all times has been
the access to resources - land, water, energy and so on. However,
along with scientific and technical progress, the rapid growth of
industrial production, the transition to fossil fuels (coal and oil),
and energy resources have taken a defining role in the development of
states. The crucial role of oil, which has become the basis for a
modern economy, most clearly manifested in the course of the Second
World War, when the outcome of the fighting was largely dependent on
a stable supply of crude oil and the possibility to produce fuel on a
large scale.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

there is competition between the suppliers of energy resources, and
it should also be built into the system of global energy security.
The most important condition for this is to depoliticize energy
security. In fact, the competition is built on the principles of
economic competition for the consumer is a logical and understandable
phenomenon. However, any use of energy resources for political
purposes in the circumstances outstripping demand leads to conflicts,
the development of which can be unpredictable. The very attempt to
make energy into a necessary condition for economic growth, the
subject of political confrontation is a challenge to global energy
security system.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

both the East China and South China seas, China and its neighbors
claim assorted atolls and islands that sit astride vast undersea oil
and gas reserves.  The waters of both have been the site of recurring
naval clashes over the past few years, with the South China Sea
recently grabbing the spotlight. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

energy-rich offshoot of the western Pacific, that sea, long a focus
of contention, is rimmed by China, Vietnam, the island of Borneo, and
the Philippine Islands.  When Vietnamese coast guard vessels
attempted to penetrate this defensive ring in an effort to drive off
the rig, they were rammed by Chinese ships and pummeled by water
cannon.  No lives have yet been lost in these encounters, but
anti-Chinese rioting in Vietnam in response to the sea-borne
encroachment left several dead and the clashes at sea are expected to
continue for several months until the Chinese move the rig to another
(possibly equally contested) location.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

global aspect can approach to the energy resources not only as a
means to trade and profit by individual players, but also as one of
the foundations of economic and wider human development of the world
as a whole. One of the outcomes of recent active discussions around
the issue of energy security has become a growing awareness that
energy, as well as, for example, the environment, has a global
dimension - a sphere in which problems and challenges relate to the
lives of every person in every country.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

ultimate goal of the development of oil and gas energy markets is the
formation of the global energy space with common rules of the “game”.
And it will be easier to play for those how set the rules. So now
those with power and influence will go fight for the long-term key
positions in this space for many years before such a space will be
finally formed.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
